Sample Programs in the Distribution
===================================

The Panda3D Distribution includes quite a few sample programs. The following is
a list of what's included, and which features of the engine each sample
demonstrates. If you are just learning Panda3D, take a look at the ones marked
as "Beginner" difficulty.

To run a sample program, you need to install the Panda3D SDK.
If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu.
If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.
On macOS, you'll find them in /Developer/Examples/Panda3D/ (or
/Library/Developer/Examples/Panda3D as of Panda3D 1.10.5).
Alternatively, you can download the samples separately from the download page.
