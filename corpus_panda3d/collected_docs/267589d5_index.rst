Panda3D Specific Resources
--------------------------

`Alice Gallery <https://www.alice.org/pandagallery/>`__. This site holds many of
the models created for use with `Alice <https://www.alice.org>`__ but exported
into the .egg format. Be advised though, some of these models may not work
properly.

Python Libraries
