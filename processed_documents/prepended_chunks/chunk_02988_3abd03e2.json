  "content": "The provided code snippet is part of an algorithm designed to efficiently pack textures (images) into a grid layout represented by bitmasks. The algorithm aims to place each texture in the most suitable available slot with minimal distortion. Specifically, the chunk demonstrates logic for finding and selecting an optimal hole in the grid where a given texture can be placed without overlap, considering both rotation and aspect ratio constraints.\n\nThe code first ensures that the texture is considered in its optimal orientation by swapping width and height if necessary. It then calculates the aspect ratio of the texture and identifies potential holes (slots) in the grid where the texture could fit. For each candidate hole, it checks whether the hole's dimensions allow for an ideal placement without requiring squishing or resizing beyond the available space.\n\nThis logic is crucial for maintaining efficient packing and minimizing wasted space, ensuring that textures are arranged optimally for rendering performance and memory usage.\n\n# Rotate the hole to horizontal first.\n        w, h = max(w, h), min(w, h)\n\n        aspect = float(w) / float(h)\n        holes = self.findAvailableHoles(area, w, h)\n\n        # Walk through the list and find the one with the best aspect\n        # match.\n        matches = []\n        for tarea, tp in holes:\n            l, r, b, t = tp.p\n            tw = r - l\n            th = t - b\n\n            # To constrain our area within this rectangle, how would\n            # we have to squish it?\n            if tw < w:\n                # We'd have to make it taller.\n                nh = min(area // tw, th)\n                th = nh\n            elif th < h:\n                # We'd have to make it narrower.\n                nw = min(area // th, tw)\n                tw = nw\n            else:\n                # Hey, we don't have to squish it after all!  Just\n                # return this hole.\n                tw = w\n                th = h",
