  "content": "The document is a comprehensive list of configuration variables in Panda3D's Config.prc file, detailing various aspects of application behavior. The chunk pertains to SSL certificate management, state caching optimization, graphics rendering with stencil buffer bits, and stereo lens convergence settings for 3D effects.\n\nseconds, we can expect to actually sleep for somewhere between 1.0 and\n1.0 + sleep-precision seconds. ssl-certificates list This variable lists additional filenames, on top of the file named\nby ca-bundle-filename, that contain trusted SSL certificates or\ncertificate authorities. state-cache bool 1 Set this true to enable the cache of RenderState objects, similar to\nthe TransformState cache controlled via transform-cache. stencil-bits int 0 (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded The minimum number of stencil buffer bits requested. stereo-lens-old-convergence bool 0 In Panda3D 1.8 and below, when using a stereo lens, Panda generate\nan incorrect frustum skew for a given convergence distance, meaning that\nthe left-right images wouldn't overlap at the configured distance. This\ncalculation has since been corrected, but if your application relies on\nthe old, incorrect behavior, this may be set to 'true' to switch back to",
