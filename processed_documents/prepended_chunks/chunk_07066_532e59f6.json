  "content": "This code chunk represents the server-side connection handling logic within a Panda3D network communication setup. It demonstrates how to process new client connections using QueuedConnectionListener, manage active connections in a list, and begin reading data from connected clients via QueuedConnectionReader. This section is crucial for setting up server-client communication infrastructure.\n\nrendezvous = PointerToConnection()\n        netAddress = NetAddress()\n        newConnection = PointerToConnection()\n\n        if cListener.getNewConnection(rendezvous,netAddress,newConnection):\n            newConnection = newConnection.p()\n            activeConnections.append(newConnection) # Remember connection\n            cReader.addConnection(newConnection)     # Begin reading connection\n    return Task.cont\n\nOnce a connection has been opened, the QueuedConnectionReader may begin processing incoming packets. This is similar to the flow of the listener's task, but it is up to the server code to handle the incoming data.\n\nfrom panda3d.core import NetDatagram",
