  "content": "The document explains how Panda's performance analysis tool, PStats, collects and visualizes data about rendering processes in single-threaded mode. The chunk discusses how display regions are processed sequentially, alternating between culling and drawing phases, and highlights the limitations of the strip chart in showing only total times. It introduces the piano roll chart as a visualization tool that reveals the sequence of events within each frame, analogous to a player piano roll.\n\nFor instance, when Panda draws each display region in single-threaded mode, it performs a cull traversal followed by a draw traversal for each display region. Thus, if your Panda client includes multiple display regions, it will alternate its time spent culling and drawing as it processes each of them. The strip chart, however, reports only the total cull time and draw time spent.\n\nSometimes you really need to know the sequence of events in the frame, not just the total time spent in each collector. The piano roll chart shows this kind of data. It is so named because it is similar to the paper music roll for an old-style player piano, with holes punched down the roll for each note that is to be played. The longer the hole, the longer the piano key is held down. (Think of the chart as rotated 90 degrees from an actual piano roll. A player piano roll plays from bottom to top; the piano roll chart reads from left to right.)",
