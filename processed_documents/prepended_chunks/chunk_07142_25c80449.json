  "content": "This chunk serves as an introductory section that explains the basics of texture filter types. It discusses how texture magnification and minification work, and describes how these processes can be controlled programmatically using specific functions for setting magnification and minification filters.\n\nTexture Filter Types\n\nIt's rare that the pixels of a texture image match one-to-one with actual screen pixels when a texture is visible onscreen. Usually, it is the case that either a single pixel of the texture is stretched over multiple screen pixels (texture magnification--the texture image is stretched bigger), or the opposite, that multiple pixels of a texture contribute to the color of a single screen pixel (texture minification--the texture image is squished smaller). Often, a single polygon will have some texture pixels that need to be magnified, and some pixels that need to be minified (the graphics card can handle both cases on a single polygon).\n\nYou can control how the texture looks when it is magnified or minified by setting its filter type.\n\npython\n\ntexture.setMagfilter(type)\ntexture.setMinfilter(type)\n\ncpp\n\ntexture->set_magfilter(type);\ntexture->set_minfilter(type);",
