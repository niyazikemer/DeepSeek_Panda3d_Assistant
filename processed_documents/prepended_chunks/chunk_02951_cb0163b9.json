  "content": "This chunk provides an explanation of how texture sizes are visually represented based on their memory consumption. It is situated within a discussion about managing and visualizing textures, particularly in the context of calculating their proportional size for display purposes in the `calculateBitmasks` method of the `TexManager` class. The comment helps explain why certain calculations are being performed when determining how much space each texture should occupy on screen.\n\nThe chunk is part of a larger discussion about efficiently managing and visualizing texture memory usage, which includes considerations for mipmaps and compression. This context explains the rationale behind the proportional sizing approach used in the code.\n\n# The visual size of each texture is chosen in proportion to\n        # the total number of bytes of texture memory the texture\n        # consumes.  This includes mipmaps, and accounts for texture\n        # compression.  Visually, a texture with mipmaps will be\n        # represented by a rectangle 33% larger than an\n        # equivalent-sized texture without mipmaps.  Of course, this\n        # once again has little bearing to the way the textures are\n        # actually arranged in memory; but it serves to give a visual\n        # indication of how much texture memory each texture consumes.",
