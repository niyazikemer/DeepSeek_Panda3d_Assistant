  "content": "The provided code is part of an `AsyncRequest` class designed for handling asynchronous operations, particularly those involving object creation and retrieval. The class manages a collection of requests and ensures that operations are completed before proceeding. The specific chunk discusses extending the functionality by chaining multiple operations through the `finish()` method.\n\n**Succinct Context:**\n\nThe code is part of an `AsyncRequest` system where multiple server-side operations (like creating or retrieving objects) can be managed asynchronously. The highlighted section explains how to chain these operations by updating the list of required objects within the `finish()` method, allowing for sequential execution of asynchronous tasks.\n\n```python\nclass AsyncRequest:\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize an AsyncRequest object. This sets up the necessary data structures and adds the request to a global tracking system.\n        \n        If you need to chain several operations (like creating or retrieving multiple objects), \n        you can add more entries to self.neededObjects within your custom finish() method, \n        preventing immediate completion until all required objects are processed.\n        \"\"\"\n        # ... rest of the code ...\n```\n\nIf you need to chain serveral object reads or creates, just add more\n    entries to the self.neededObjects dictionary in the self.finish function\n    and return without calling AsyncRequest.finish().  Your finish method\n    will be called again when the new self.neededObjects is complete.  You\n    may repeat this as necessary.\n    \"\"\"\n    _asyncRequests: dict[int, AsyncRequest] = {}\n\n    notify = DirectNotifyGlobal.directNotify.newCategory('AsyncRequest')",
