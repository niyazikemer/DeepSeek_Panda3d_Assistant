  "content": "The chunk discusses how the `filter` function can modify or create new sets of arguments when processing state transitions in an FSM, emphasizing its role in filtering both state transitions and associated data. This section appears within a broader discussion on FSM behavior and state management techniques.\n\nThe returned arguments are not necessarily the same as the ones passed in, however. The filter function is free to check, modify, or rearrange any of them; or it might even make up a completely new set of arguments. In this way, the filter function can filter not only the state transitions themselves, but also the set of data passed along with the request.\n\ncpp\n\nThis section does not apply to C++ users.",
