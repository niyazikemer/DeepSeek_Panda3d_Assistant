  "content": "The chunk is part of a Panda3D-related codebase that implements classes for phase-based collision detection. The `BufferedDistancePhasedNode` class extends the `DistancePhasedNode` class to add support for buffer zones around phase boundaries to prevent phase flickering due to repeated boundary crossings. The methods in this chunk, `__handleExitEvent` and `__oneTimeCollide`, are helper functions that manage event processing when exiting a phase and trigger one-time collision traversal respectively.\n\ndef __handleExitEvent(self, phaseName, cEntry):\n        phase = self.getAliasPhase(phaseName) - 1\n        self.setPhase(phase)\n\n    def __oneTimeCollide(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Fire off a one-time collision traversal of the\n        scene graph.  This allows us to process our entire\n        phasing process in one frame in the cases where\n        we cross more than one phase border.\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.cTrav:\n            if self.cTrav is base.cTrav:\n                # we use 'render'here since if we only try to\n                # traverse ourself, we end up calling exit\n                # events for the rest of the eventHandlers.\n                # Consider supplying the fromCollideNode parameter.\n                self.cTrav.traverse(render)\n            else:\n                # Only traverse ourself\n                self.cTrav.traverse(self)\n            base.eventMgr.doEvents()",
