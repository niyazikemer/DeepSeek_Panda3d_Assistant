This context is essential for users preparing their 3D assets correctly before using the maya2egg exporter.\n\nContext: When setting up textured models in Maya for export to Panda3D, it's crucial to ensure materials and shaders are configured properly.\n\nA straightforwardly textured model will look like this in the hypershade:\n\nTo apply a normal map, create another file texture and connect the \"out color\" of the normal map to the \"normal camera\" input of the phong shader. The normal map must be a true normal map (you can recognize them by their light blue color), not a bump map (which are black-and-white.)\n\nUnfortunately, there is a maya button to help you set up a bump map, but what it creates is not correct for Panda3D. If you use the button, you end up with the following incorrect configuration. So far as I know, the only way to get the correct configuration (shown above) is to set it up manually in the hypershade. The incorrect configuration is:",
