  "content": "This chunk is the introductory section of a comprehensive document that explains how to use glTF files in applications. It describes the glTF format as an industry standard for delivering 3D assets to 3D engines, its structure based on JSON, binary variants (e.g., .glb), and version differences between 1.0 and 2.0, emphasizing the importance of using version 2.0.\n\nglTF Files\n\nThe glTF format is the industry standard file format for delivering 3D assets (models and scenes) to 3D engines. It is an open standard maintained by the Khronos Group, with contributors across the industry. It is widely supported as an export format by 3D modelling programs and an import format by game engines.\n\nThe format is based around JSON, a common text-based data interchange format. Like .egg, a file with the .gltf extension can be inspected using a text editor, or it can be programmatically manipulated by any JSON parsing library. There is also a binary variant of the format, .glb, which is used if you wish to pack the textual JSON tree together with any external binary data into the same file efficiently.\n\nAt the time of writing, there are two versions of the glTF standard, version 1.0 and version 2.0, with substantial differences between them. It is recommended to use version 2.0, which is much more prevalent than 1.0.",
