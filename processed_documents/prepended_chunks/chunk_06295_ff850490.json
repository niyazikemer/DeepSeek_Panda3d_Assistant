  "content": "The document provides detailed instructions on using the Panda exporter tools within Maya, including setting up exporters, integrating them into Maya's interface, and optimizing assets. The chunk sits within this context by noting that while the graphical front-end only supports `maya2egg`, other optimization tools can work with any correctly exported egg files, highlighting compatibility beyond Maya.\n\nno changes to their settings after minor tweaks within the 3D package. It should also be noted this tool currently only supports the maya2egg exporter, but since the other optimization tools operate on egg files they can be used with any egg file that has been correctly exported from any 3D package.",
