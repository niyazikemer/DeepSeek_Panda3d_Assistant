The code examples show replacing textures on car body components.\n\"\"\"\n\ncpp\n\nNodePath smiley;  \nPT(Texture) tex;  \n\nsmiley = window->load_model(window->get_render(), \"smiley.egg\");  \ntex = TexturePool::load_texture(\"maps/noise.rgb\");  \nsmiley.set_texture(tex, 1);  \n\nOften, you want to replace the texture on just one piece of a model, rather than setting the texture on every element. To do this, you simply get a .NodePath handle to the piece or pieces of the model that you want to change, as described in the section manipulating-a-piece-of-a-model, and make the .NodePath.set_texture() call on those NodePaths.\n\nFor instance, this car model has multiple textures available in different colors:\n\nFor the most part, this car was painted with one big texture image, which looks like this:\n\nBut we also have a blue version of the same texture image:\n```\n\ncpp\n\nNodePath smiley;\nPT(Texture) tex;\n\nsmiley = window->load_model(window->get_render(), \"smiley.egg\");\ntex = TexturePool::load_texture(\"maps/noise.rgb\");\nsmiley.set_texture(tex, 1);\n\nOften, you want to replace the texture on just one piece of a model, rather than setting the texture on every element.
