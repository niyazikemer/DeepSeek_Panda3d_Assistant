  "content": "This chunk discusses a caveat related to collision detection involving the CollisionHandlerFloor in Panda3D, explaining how it can allow objects to slip through floors despite the use of previous transform state information, particularly when an avatar is navigating sloped surfaces.\n\nThe CollisionHandlerFloor is especially bad about allowing objects to slip through floors, in spite of the previous transform state, especially when you avatar is walking up a sloping path. This is just because of the way the CollisionHandlerFloor works. If you are having problems with the CollisionHandlerFloor, consider reducing the slope of your floors, increasing the height of the ray above the ground, and/or reducing the speed of your avatar.",
