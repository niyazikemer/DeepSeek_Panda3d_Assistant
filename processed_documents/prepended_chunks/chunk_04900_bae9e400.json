  "content": "The chunk is part of a method responsible for replacing the current graphics window with a new one, while preserving certain properties (like clear color, depth, and stencil) from the old window. It handles closing the existing window, opening a new window, setting up mouse controls and 2D camera for the new window, and restoring the old window if the new window fails to open. The context is situated within a class managing multi-window graphics operations, with a focus on window replacement and state management.\n\nsuccess = 1\n        oldWin = self.win\n        oldLens = self.camLens\n        oldClearColorActive = None\n        if self.win is not None:\n            # Close the previous window.\n            oldClearColorActive = self.win.getClearColorActive()\n            oldClearColor = VBase4(self.win.getClearColor())\n            oldClearDepthActive = self.win.getClearDepthActive()\n            oldClearDepth = self.win.getClearDepth()\n            oldClearStencilActive = self.win.getClearStencilActive()\n            oldClearStencil = self.win.getClearStencil()\n            self.closeWindow(self.win, keepCamera = keepCamera)\n\n        # Open a new window.\n        self.openWindow(*args, **kw)\n        if self.win is None:\n            self.win = oldWin\n            self.winList.append(oldWin)\n            success = 0\n\n        if self.win is not None:\n            if isinstance(self.win, GraphicsWindow):\n                self.setupMouse(self.win)\n            self.makeCamera2d(self.win)",
