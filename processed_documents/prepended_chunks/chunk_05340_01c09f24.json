  "content": "This chunk contains global configuration settings for controlling how avatars' movements are synchronized across clients. These settings include parameters for enabling or disabling smooth motion interpolation (smoothing) and predictive extrapolation of positions (prediction), as well as the time delays used in these processes. The variables defined here influence how often resynchronization is suggested between clients, and they determine whether smoothing and prediction features are enabled to compensate for network latency.\n\n# How frequently can we suggest a resynchronize with another client?\nMinSuggestResync = ConfigVariableDouble(\"smooth-min-suggest-resync\", 15)\n\n# These flags indicate whether global smoothing and/or prediction is\n# allowed or disallowed.\nEnableSmoothing = ConfigVariableBool(\"smooth-enable-smoothing\", True)\nEnablePrediction = ConfigVariableBool(\"smooth-enable-prediction\", True)\n\n# These values represent the amount of time, in seconds, to delay the\n# apparent position of other avatars, when non-predictive and\n# predictive smoothing is in effect, respectively.  This is in\n# addition to the automatic delay of the observed average latency from\n# each avatar, which is intended to compensate for relative clock\n# skew.\nLag = ConfigVariableDouble(\"smooth-lag\", 0.2)\nPredictionLag = ConfigVariableDouble(\"smooth-prediction-lag\", 0.0)\n\n\nGlobalSmoothing = 0\nGlobalPrediction = 0",
