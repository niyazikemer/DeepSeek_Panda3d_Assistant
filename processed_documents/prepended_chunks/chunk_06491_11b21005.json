  "content": "The provided chunk discusses optimizing collision detection in Panda3D by simplifying collision meshes and using fewer polygons to improve performance. It situates within a section addressing excessive detail in collision geometry, recommending simplified meshes or low-poly versions for efficient collision testing.\n\nThe argument is the number of solids to put in the leaves of the hierarchy. You can experiment with this number to find the value that gives the best performance.\n\nExcessive Detail\n\nIf the collision geometry is constructed from the version of the mesh that is used for rendering, it is possible that there are so many triangles in the mesh that it is slow to test against. In these situations, it is recommended to instead construct a simplified version of the mesh. Ideally, this simplified mesh consists of collision-solids such as spheres, boxes and capsules, but in some situations it is necessary to build it up from individual polygons. A low-poly version of the mesh can then be used instead, either by constructing it manually or by using an automatic quality reduction algorithm (such as the Decimate modifier in Blender) to create a collision mesh with fewer polygons.",
