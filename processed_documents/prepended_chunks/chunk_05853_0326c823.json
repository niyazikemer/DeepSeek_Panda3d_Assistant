  "content": "The chunk discusses additional controls for enhancing user interaction with the mouse cursor, including re-centering and visibility toggles. It highlights strategies to maintain smooth mouse operations and directs users to further details in the manual, while providing a link back to the sample programs list.\n\nThe 'c' key toggles automatic re-centering of the mouse cursor, which is a strategy to avoid allowing the cursor to leave the window. This is on by default, so any one of the three modes will generally provide a smooth mouse experience, but with rapid enough movements, the mouse can leave the window in \"absolute\" mode.\n\nFinally, the 's' key toggles the visibility of the mouse cursor.\n\nThe mouse-support section of the manual covers the mouse modes, detecting whether a mouse mode is supported, and a strategy for re-centering the mouse, as used by this sample.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
