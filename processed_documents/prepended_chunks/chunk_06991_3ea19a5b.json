  "content": "The chunk describes the `base.oobe()` method in Panda, which provides an out-of-body experience (OOBE) camera control. This feature allows users to freely move the camera node (`base.camera`) using the mouse or trackball while continuing to execute code that moves the camera. The `oobeCull()` variant maintains scene culling based on the original camera position, enabling developers to see how objects enter and exit the view frustum as they navigate around the world.\n\nThe context is situated within a section of the document discussing various methods for controlling the camera in Panda. After explaining the default mouse-driven camera task, keyboard controls with `useDrive()`, and trackball control, this chunk introduces advanced debugging tools like OOBE mode to help visualize and debug scene interactions from different perspectives while retaining control over the camera's position programmatically.\n\nIn summary, the chunk explains how to use `base.oobe()` and `base.oobeCull()` for debugging purposes, allowing developers to examine their scenes from any vantage point while maintaining culling based on the original camera placement.\n\nbase.oobe()\n\n~direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.oobeCull() is a variant on ~direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.oobe(), and it works similarly, except that it still culls the scene as if the camera were still in its original position, while drawing the scene from the point of view of your camera's new position. So now you can view the scene from your \"out of body\" placement, and walk around, and you can see things popping in and out of view as your view frustum moves around the world.",
