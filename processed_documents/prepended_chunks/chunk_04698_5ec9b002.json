  "content": "The chunk defines the mathematical constant known as the golden ratio, also referred to by the Greek letter phi (\u03c6), which is approximately equal to 1.618. This value is derived from the formula `(1 + sqrt(5)) / 2`. The golden ratio has applications in various fields including mathematics, art, and architecture due to its aesthetically pleasing properties. In this document, it's being added as a constant for potential use in related calculations or algorithms within the codebase.\n\nContext: Mathematical Constant Definition\n\n```python\n# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio\nGoldenRatio = (1. + math.sqrt(5.)) / 2.\n```\n\n# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio\nGoldenRatio = (1. + math.sqrt(5.)) / 2.",
