The specific section discusses options related to model processing, optimization, and visualization, particularly focusing on geometry handling and rendering efficiency.\n\ncases, doing so can distort the UV's on a face; turning this off should\neliminate that artifact (at the cost of less-effective triangle\nstripping). egg-rigid-geometry bool 0 Set this true to create rigid pieces of an animated character as\nseparate static nodes, or false to leave these in with the parent node\nas vertex-animated geometry. Setting this true means less geometry has\nto be vertex-animated, but there will tend to be more separate\npieces. egg-show-normals bool 0 egg-show-qsheets bool 0 Set this true to color each quadsheet a random color, so you can\nvisually observe the quadsheet algorithm. egg-show-quads bool 0 Set this true to color each detected quad a random color, so you can\nvisually observe the algorithm that unifies pairs of triangles into\nquads (prior to generating triangle strips). egg-show-tstrips bool 0 Set this true to color each triangle strip a random color, with the\nleading triangle a little bit darker, so you can visually observe the",
