  "content": "The File Formats section explains the native and supported formats used by Panda3D for models, including EGG (human-readable), BAM (optimized binary), and other industry-standard formats like glTF via plugins.\n\nFile Formats\n\nModels can be stored in one of a number of file formats. Panda3D's own native format for storing models is EGG. This is a human-readable format containing a textual description of the geometry and its animations and materials. Panda3D provides various tools that can convert model files from other formats to the EGG format, and manipulate EGG files in various ways.\n\nThe other native format of Panda3D is the BAM format, which is a binary representation of the internal object structure of Panda3D. As such, it is very efficient to load. Therefore, it is also the format of choice when shipping the game to an end-user. Panda3D will automatically convert your models to BAM for caching purposes, or when packaging a finished game for distribution.\n\nThere are a range of plug-ins available to load models in other formats, such as the glTF format <gltf-files>, which is a widely-used format in the industry. See supported-model-formats for more information about supported formats.",
