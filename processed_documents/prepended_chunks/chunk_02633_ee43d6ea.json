  "content": "The chunk introduces two new methods (`getCurrentFilter` and `getCurrentOrNextState`) that manage state transitions and request processing within a Finite State Machine (FSM) implementation. These methods dynamically determine the current filter for handling requests or identify the FSM's current/next state, enhancing flexibility and maintainability of the system by enabling state-specific request handling during transitions.\n\ndef getCurrentFilter(self):\n        if not self.state:\n            error = \"FSM cannot determine current filter while in transition (%s -> %s).\" % (self.oldState, self.newState)\n            raise AlreadyInTransition(error)\n\n        filter = getattr(self, \"filter\" + self.state, None)\n        if not filter:\n            # If there's no matching filterState() function, call\n            # defaultFilter() instead.\n            filter = self.defaultFilter\n\n        return filter\n\n    def getCurrentOrNextState(self):\n        # Returns the current state if we are in a state now, or the\n        # state we are transitioning into if we are currently within\n        # the enter or exit function for a state.\n        self.fsmLock.acquire()\n        try:\n            if self.state:\n                return self.state\n            return self.newState\n        finally:\n            self.fsmLock.release()",
