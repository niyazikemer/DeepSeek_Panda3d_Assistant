  "content": "This chunk appears in a section of code that sets up collision detection and handling for an avatar in a 3D environment. The `pusher` and `lifter` collision handlers are initialized here to manage interactions with walls and floors, respectively. These handlers use specific collider node paths (`cSphereNodePath` and `cRayNodePath`) attached to the avatar's node path to detect collisions and maintain proper positioning within the scene. This setup is essential for enabling realistic movement and preventing the avatar from passing through objects or floating above surfaces.\n\n# set up wall collision mechanism\n        self.pusher = CollisionHandlerPusher()\n        self.pusher.setInPattern(\"enter%in\")\n        self.pusher.setOutPattern(\"exit%in\")\n\n        # set up floor collision mechanism\n        self.lifter = CollisionHandlerFloor()\n        self.lifter.setInPattern(\"on-floor\")\n        self.lifter.setOutPattern(\"off-floor\")\n        self.lifter.setOffset(floorOffset)\n        self.lifter.setReach(reach)\n\n        # Limit our rate-of-fall with the lifter.\n        # If this is too low, we actually \"fall\" off steep stairs\n        # and float above them as we go down.
