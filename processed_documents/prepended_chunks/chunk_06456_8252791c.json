  "content": "The chunk explains how to manage texture rendering priorities when a node has more TextureStages than supported by the hardware, using .TextureStage.set_priority(). It complements the discussion of texture order by introducing an additional mechanism for selecting which textures are rendered first.\n\nAlso, since some hardware might not be able to render all of the TextureStages that you have defined on a particular node, Panda provides a way for you to specify which texture(s) are the most important. Use .TextureStage.set_priority() for this.\n\nThe priority value is only consulted when you have applied more TextureStages to a particular node than your current hardware can render. In this case, Panda will select the n textures with the highest priority value (and then sort them in order by the ~.TextureStage.set_sort() value). Between two textures with the same priority, Panda will prefer the one with the lower sort value. The default priority is 0.",
