  "content": "The chunk discusses the licensing and patent considerations for Opus, followed by details about FFMPEG, FMOD Ex, and Bullet Physics. It situates Opus within the context of recommended audio alternatives to patented formats like MP3, while explaining FFMPEG's role in video/audio processing and FMOD Ex's proprietary nature with commercial licensing options.\n\nLicense: 3-clause BSD\n\nPatent note: Must agree not to litigate against other Opus users.\n\nFFMPEG\n\nhttp://ffmpeg.org\n\nLibrary for video and audio. Required to load and play video textures. As of Panda3D 1.9.0, libp3ffmpeg.dll is an optional module that can be easily removed, and is no longer required for .ogg and .wav files.\n\nLicense: LGPL\n\nLicense note: Must link dynamically.\n\nPatent note: using MP3 files and other formats may require you to pay royalty fees. Please use .ogg or .opus instead.\n\nFMOD Ex\n\nhttps://www.fmod.com/\n\nFMOD Ex is a proprietary audio library that supports various effects and surround sound. You must have one of FMOD or OpenAL to build support for Panda's sound interfaces. (However, you can use external sound libraries such as pygame, even without these two.)\n\nLicense: Proprietary\n\nLicense note: Non-commercial distribution costs nothing. Commercial distribution costs between US$100 and US$6000 depending on FMOD licensing option.\n\nBullet Physics",
