  "content": "The chunk appears in a section discussing how to configure and effectively utilize occluders in Panda, providing specific methods to optimize their behavior and general recommendations for their usage in improving scene rendering efficiency.\n\nOccluder Configuration\n\nBesides the shape of the occluder, there are other settings which affect how the occluder behaves. Use the ~.OccluderNode.set_double_sided() method on the OccluderNode to enable the occluder to work on both sides. This is desirable for example if the occluder is placed inside of a wall. A double-sided occluder is more efficient than creating two occluders with opposite normals. Use the ~.OccluderNode.set_min_coverage() method to ignore an occluder that doesn't take up at least a certain amount of screen space.\n\nGeneral Occluder Advice\n\nMore is not always better. Occluders do have a cost, so use them sparingly where they will make the biggest difference. If you have a lot of occluders, it might help to evaluate your occluders every once in a while and only use the closest ones. The optimal amount and configuration of occluders depends on the makeup of your scene. Test different configurations and compare the frame rates.",
