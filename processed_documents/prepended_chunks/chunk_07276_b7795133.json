  "content": "This chunk introduces three specific collision shape types: `BulletCapsuleShape`, `BulletConeShape`, and `CompoundShape`. These are additional primitive and complex collision shapes used in physics simulations. The capsule shape is a cylinder with hemispherical ends, the cone shape represents a conical geometry, and compound shapes allow combining multiple simpler shapes to create complex collision geometries for objects like tables or vehicles.\n\ncpp\n\n#include \"bulletCapsuleShape.h\"\n...\ndouble radius = 0.5;\ndouble height = 1.0;\nPT(BulletCapsuleShape) capsule_shape = new BulletCapsuleShape(radius, height);\n\nCone Shape\n\nAgain a primitive collision shape, which represents a cone. We have to pass the radius of the circular base of the cone, and it's height.\n\npython\n\nfrom panda3d.bullet import BulletConeShape\nradius = 0.6\nheight = 1.0\nshape = BulletConeShape(radius, height, ZUp)\n\ncpp\n\n#include \"bulletConeShape.h\"\n...\ndouble radius = 0.6;\ndouble height = 1.0;\nPT(BulletConeShape) cone_shape = new BulletConeShape(radius, height);\n\nCompound Shape\n\nCompound shapes are assemblies made up from two or more individual shapes. For example you could create a collision shape for a table from five box shapes. One \"flat\" box for the table plate, and four \"thin\" ones for the table legs.",
