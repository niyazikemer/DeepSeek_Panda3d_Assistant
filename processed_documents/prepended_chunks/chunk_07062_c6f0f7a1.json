  "content": "This chunk introduces the foundational concepts of establishing a client-server connection in network communication using Panda3D, focusing on preparing the server side with essential classes like QueuedConnectionManager, QueuedConnectionListener, QueuedConnectionReader, and ConnectionWriter.\n\nClient-Server Connection\n\nThe first step in network communication is to establish the client-server connection. This entails two sets of operations: one for the server side (which listens for incoming connections), and one for the client side (which establishes a connection to the server). Both of these processes are described below.\n\nPreparing the server for connection\n\nAn average Panda program acting as a server will need to create four classes:\n\nA .QueuedConnectionManager, which handles the low-level connection processes, establishes connections, and handles unexpected network termination\n\nA .QueuedConnectionListener, which waits for clients to request a connection\n\nA .QueuedConnectionReader, which buffers incoming data from an active connection\n\nA .ConnectionWriter, which allows PyDatagrams to be transmitted out along an active connection\n\nThe first step is to instantiate these four classes.",
