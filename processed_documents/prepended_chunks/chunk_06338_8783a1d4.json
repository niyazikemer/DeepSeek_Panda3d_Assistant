  "content": "To create a `NodePath` from an .egg file source string in Panda3D:\n\n1. **Parse the Egg Data**: Use `EggData` to read the egg model data from a string using `StringStream`.\n2. **Convert to NodePath**: Utilize `loadEggData` function to convert the parsed egg data into a `NodePath`.\n\n**Example Code:**\n\n```python\nfrom panda3d.core import EggData, StringStream\n\n# Assume 'eggText' is your .egg file content as a string\negg = EggData()\negg.read(StringStream(eggText))\nmodel_node = loadEggData(egg)\nmodel = NodePath(model_node)\n```\n\nThis allows dynamic loading of models from strings without needing physical files.\n\nThe problem is that everything that happens within one frame is deemed to happen at the same time. This is the \"frame time\" of the clock object--it is the time as of the start of the frame, and everything you do within that frame is deemed to have happened at the \"frame time\".\n\nThis is usually a good thing, because it makes the simulation internally consistent. Frames are atomic. If you start five animations in a row with five different calls to actor.start(), you want them all to have \"started\" at the exact same time, not within a few milliseconds of each other. If you start an interval, you also want it to have started at the same time as every other atomic operation in that frame.",
