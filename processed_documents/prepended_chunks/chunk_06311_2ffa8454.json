  "content": "The provided chunk offers guidance on how to make the Panda Exporter tool more accessible within Maya. Specifically, it explains how to add a shortcut to the Maya shelf for quick access and provides additional instructions for Windows users on utilizing the QuickLaunch bar for even faster launches of the exporter tool into Maya's 3D window. This enhances workflow efficiency by allowing users to quickly access essential tools without navigating through multiple menus or windows.\n\n**Context:** These steps are about integrating the Panda Exporter tool directly into Maya's interface, either via a shelf icon or the QuickLaunch bar for Windows users, to streamline access and improve productivity when working with 3D assets.\n\nAnytime you need to open the Panda Exporter, just click the icon on the shelf.\n\nFor Windows users:\n\nIf you want a faster launch, you can put the MEL file on the QuickLaunch. Press Ctrl while dragging the MEL file onto QuickLaunch bar. If you don't press Ctrl, the actual file dropped to QuickLaunch is only the shortcut to the MEL file.\n\nAnytime you need to open the Panda exporter, just drag it from QuickLaunch bar to the 3D window of Maya.",
