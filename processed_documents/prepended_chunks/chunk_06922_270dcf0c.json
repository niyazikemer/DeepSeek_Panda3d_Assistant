  "content": "When working with 3D models in Panda3D, you may need to replace specific materials across different parts of a model. For example, after loading a car model, you might want to change all instances of a \"blueMetal\" material to a newly defined red material. The `replaceMaterial` method allows you to dynamically update all occurrences of one material with another throughout the entire model, ensuring consistent visual changes without manually reassigning materials to each part.\n\ncar.replaceMaterial(blue, red)\n\ncpp\n\nPT(Material) blue = car.find_material(\"blueMetal\");\nPT(Material) red = new Material;\n//...set up red material\n\ncar.replace_material(blue, red);\n\nRelated Classes\n\npanda3d.core.Material\n\npanda3d.core.MaterialCollection",
