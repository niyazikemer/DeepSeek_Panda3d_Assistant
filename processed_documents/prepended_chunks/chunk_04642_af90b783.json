  "content": "The code chunk defines a utility function `stackEntryInfo()` for retrieving stack trace information (filename, line number, function name) at a specified depth in the call stack. It is placed within the debugging utilities section of the document, alongside other functions like `printStack`, `printReverseStack`, and `printVerboseStack`. This context makes it easily discoverable when searching for debugging or profiling tools.\n\nThe function uses Python's `inspect` module to introspect the call stack and returns information about a specific frame. It is particularly useful for tracking execution flow, identifying where errors occur, or logging program state during runtime. The placement of this function in the document aligns with its purpose as a debugging aid, making it easier to locate when working on error handling or tracing code execution paths.\n\nif __debug__:\n    def stackEntryInfo(depth=0, baseFileName=1):\n        \"\"\"\n        returns the sourcefilename, line number, and function name of\n        an entry in the stack.\n        'depth' is how far back to go in the stack; 0 is the caller of this\n        function, 1 is the function that called the caller of this function, etc.\n        by default, strips off the path of the filename; override with baseFileName\n        returns (fileName, lineNum, funcName) --> (string, int, string)\n        returns (None, None, None) on error\n        \"\"\"\n        import inspect",
