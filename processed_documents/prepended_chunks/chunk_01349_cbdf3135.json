  "content": "The chunk provides an introduction to the `DirectFrame` class within Panda3D's DirectGUI system, describing its purpose as a base component that can hold other GUI elements and support multiple states. It also includes essential imports and module exports necessary for implementing this functionality.\n\nclass for various other components, and can also serve as a basic\ncontainer to hold other DirectGUI components.\n\nA DirectFrame can have:\n\n* A background texture (pass in path to image, or Texture Card)\n* A midground geometry item (pass in geometry)\n* A foreground text Node (pass in text string or OnscreenText)\n\nEach of these has 1 or more states.  The same object can be used for\nall states or each state can have a different text/geom/image (for\nradio button and check button indicators, for example).\n\nSee the :ref:`directframe` page in the programming manual for a more in-depth\nexplanation and an example of how to use this class.\n\"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ['DirectFrame']\n\nfrom panda3d.core import Filename, NodePath, PGItem, Texture\nfrom . import DirectGuiGlobals as DGG\nfrom .DirectGuiBase import DirectGuiWidget\nfrom .OnscreenImage import OnscreenImage\nfrom .OnscreenGeom import OnscreenGeom\nfrom .OnscreenText import OnscreenText",
