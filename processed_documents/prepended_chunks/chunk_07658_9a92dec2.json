  "content": "This chunk explains the importance of maintaining a specific order when adding switches and reparenting LODs in Panda3D, ensuring the correct functioning of level of detail transitions.\n\nNote that the order in which the switches are added must be the same as the order in which the LODs are reparented to the LODNode's NodePath. This is important to remember if you are not reparenting the LOD immediately after adding the switch.",
