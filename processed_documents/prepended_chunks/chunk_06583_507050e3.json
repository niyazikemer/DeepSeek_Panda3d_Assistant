  "content": "The provided chunk discusses the default font files included with Panda3D and introduces font quality adjustments to improve rendering clarity for large text.\n\nThere are three default font files supplied with the default distribution of Panda3D in the models subdirectory; these are \"cmr12.egg\", a Roman font, \"cmss12.egg\", a Sans-Serif font, and \"cmtt12.egg\", a Teletypewriter-style fixed-width font. These three fonts were generated from free fonts provided with the Metafont utility (which is not a part of Panda3D). There is also a default font image which is compiled into Panda if you do not load any other font.\n\nFont Quality\n\nOccasionally, i.e. when displaying large characters and irrespective of the font used, the default font quality won't be enough and the characters will show noticeable blurring, especially along curving edges. The way to overcome this is to set appropriately the pixels per unit value of the font object. This is done through the method ~.DynamicTextFont.set_pixels_per_unit() of the class ~panda3d.core.DynamicTextFont, e.g.:\n\npython\n\nfont.setPixelsPerUnit(60)\n\ncpp",
