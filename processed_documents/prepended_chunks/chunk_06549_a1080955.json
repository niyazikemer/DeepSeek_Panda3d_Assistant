  "content": "The document provides an overview of various techniques for controlling and managing animations on actors in Panda3D, including playing animations, blending them, creating subparts for different body sections, enabling frame interpolation, and using intervals for fine-grained control. The chunk discusses two specific methods: ActorIntervals, which offer advanced animation control but come with performance trade-offs, and the importance of the Task Manager for scheduling tasks in complex applications involving animations or sounds.\n\nContext: Discusses alternative methods for controlling actor animations (ActorIntervals) and managing application tasks (Task Manager) in Panda3D.\n\nActor Intervals\n\nAnother way to play an animation on an actor is to use an ActorInterval <actor-intervals>, which gives you a lot more frame-by-frame control over the animation, and is particularly useful when building a complex script using Intervals. However, the ActorInterval interface is a little bit slower than the above interfaces at runtime, so you should prefer the more fundamental interfaces unless there is a good reason to use ActorInterval.\n\nThe Task Manager",
