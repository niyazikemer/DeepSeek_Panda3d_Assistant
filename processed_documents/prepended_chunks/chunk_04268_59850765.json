  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a method within the `GarbageReport` class that generates a detailed report about garbage objects detected in the system. The chunk specifically adds a section to the report that lists each garbage item and what other items (referents) it references, which helps in identifying potential memory leaks or circular dependencies.\n\n**Context:**  \nThe code is part of a garbage detection tool that logs information about garbage objects, their referents, and cycles. It iterates through each detected garbage item and appends formatted information about the referents to the report string `s`, aiding in debugging and memory leak analysis.\n\ns.append('===== Referents (what is garbage item referring to?) =====')\n                for i in range(numGarbage):\n                    yield None\n                    s.append(format % (i, self.referentsByReference[i]))",
