  "content": "The provided code chunk sets up collision handling for an avatar in a 3D environment, initializing either a `CollisionHandlerFloor` (when `useLifter` is True) to manage floor collisions or a `CollisionHandlerQueue` for broader collision detection. This setup occurs during the initialization of the avatar's physics and control mechanisms, determining how the avatar interacts with the environment's surfaces and objects.\n\n**Context:** The code initializes collision handling for an avatar in a 3D environment by setting up either a lifter mechanism or a queue-based approach based on the `useLifter` flag. This is part of the avatar's physics setup to manage interactions with the environment, such as detecting floors or collisions.\n\nif self.useLifter:\n            # set up floor collision mechanism\n            self.lifter = CollisionHandlerFloor()\n            self.lifter.setInPattern(\"enter%in\")\n            self.lifter.setOutPattern(\"exit%in\")\n            self.lifter.setOffset(floorOffset)\n\n            # Limit our rate-of-fall with the lifter.\n            # If this is too low, we actually \"fall\" off steep stairs\n            # and float above them as we go down.
