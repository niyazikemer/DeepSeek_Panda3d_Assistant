  "content": "This chunk is situated in a section explaining how to manage and control a ParticleEffect object in Panda3D, including resetting, stopping, removing, and saving particle configurations after starting the effect.\n\nParticleEffect inherits from NodePath, so you can use NodePath methods like setPos() on it.\n\nTo reset the ParticleEffect, use:\n\np.reset()\n\nTo stop the ParticleEffect, use:\n\np.disable()\n\nTo completely remove the ParticleEffect, use:\n\np.cleanup()\n\nNote that cleanup() calls disable() internally, so you don't need to call it yourself before calling cleanup()\n\nLike loadConfig(), you can use saveConfig() to save the ParticleEffect to a particle configuration file (*.ptf):\n\np.saveConfig(filename)",
