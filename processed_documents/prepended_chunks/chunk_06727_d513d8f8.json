In forced mode or limited mode,\nsets our target frame rate. In normal mode, this has no effect. See\nClockObject::set_frame_rate(). clock-mode enum normal Specifies the mode of the global clock. The default mode, normal, is\na real-time clock; other modes allow non-real-time special effects like\nsimulated reduced frame rate. See ClockObject::set_mode(). cluster-mode string DConfig cluster-sync bool 0 DConfig collect-tcp bool 0 Set this true to enable accumulation of several small consecutive\nTCP datagrams into one large datagram before sending it, to reduce\noverhead from the TCP/IP protocol. See Connection::set_collect_tcp() or\nSocketStream::set_collect_tcp(). collect-tcp-interval double 0.2 collision-parabola-bounds-sample int 10 This is the number of points along a CollisionParabola to sample in",
