  "content": "The chunk is part of the documentation for a MotionTrail class in a Python file that implements motion trail functionality, specifically explaining the use of NURBS curves and the C++ implementation optimization.\n\nThe `use_nurbs` option can be used to create smooth interpolated curves\n    from the samples.  This option is useful for animations that lack sampling\n    to begin with, animations that move very quickly, or low frame rates, or if\n    `sampling_time` is used to artificially slow down the update frequency.\n\n    By default, the optimized C++ implementation (provided by `.CMotionTrail`)\n    is used to generate the motion trails.  If for some reason you want to use\n    the pure-Python implementation instead, set `want-python-motion-trails` to\n    true in Config.prc.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    notify = directNotify.newCategory(\"MotionTrail\")\n\n    task_added = False\n    motion_trail_list: list[MotionTrail] = []\n    motion_trail_task_name = \"motion_trail_task\"\n\n    global_enable = True",
