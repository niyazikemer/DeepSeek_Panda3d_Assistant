  "content": "The chunk is part of a section discussing memory barriers in Panda3D when using compute shaders and image operations. It explains how Panda3D manages synchronization between shader writes and subsequent reads, the potential performance impact, and options for disabling automatic memory barriers if not needed.\n\nSince Panda3D does not know whether you have actually written to the image or whether you have declared an image variable as coherent, it may do this too often, causing slight performance degradation. If you are confident that you don't need this feature, you may set gl-enable-memory-barriers variable to false in your Config.prc to disable this behavior.\n\nKeep in mind that Panda3D's memory barriers only play a role when an image is modified by one shader and read by another; it does not affect reads and writes performed within the same shader. It is still necessary to use the appropriate GLSL qualifiers and memory barrier commands for these purposes.",
