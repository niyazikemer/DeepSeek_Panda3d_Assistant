This functionality is part of a larger class that manages object manipulation tools, including scaling operations. The `multiplyScalingFactorBy` method scales the object handles' size by a given factor and animates the change using an interval-based animation system.\n\ndef multiplyScalingFactorBy(self, factor):\n        self.ohScalingFactor = self.ohScalingFactor * factor\n        sf = self.ohScalingFactor * self.directScalingFactor\n        ival = self.scalingNode.scaleInterval(0.5, (sf, sf, sf),\n                                              blendType = 'easeInOut',\n                                              name = 'resizeObjectHandles')\n        ival.start()",
