  "content": "The chunk is situated within a section discussing basic performance diagnostics in 3D rendering using Panda3D. It explains the concepts of frame rate (FPS) and frame time, highlighting their importance in understanding performance bottlenecks during game development. This section appears under \"basic-performance-diagnostics\" and is part of the broader discussion on measuring performance with PStats and addressing common performance issues.\n\nThe most commonly used metric for performance by gamers is the frame rate, an average of the number of frames that are rendered in a single second (FPS). You can enable a display showing this number in Panda3D by enabling the show-frame-rate-meter setting in the Config.prc <configuring-panda3d> file. However, developers prefer to talk about the reciprocal of this number, the frame time, usually measured in milliseconds. This is because FPS is not a linear scale and therefore gives a distorted view: I have seen developers panic because their frame rate decreased from 1000 FPS to 500 FPS, which seems like a lot, but it represents only a difference of 1 millisecond, which is about the same as reducing your frame rate from 30 to 29 FPS.",
