Set this true to enable the\nold behavior for multifiles: all subfiles are always added to and\nextracted from the multifile in binary mode. Set it false to enable the\nnew behavior: subfiles may be added or extracted in either binary or\ntext mode, according to the set_binary() or set_text() flag on the\nFilename. multisamples int 0 (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded The minimum number of samples requested. name-deleted-mutexes bool 0 Set this true to allocate a name to each Mutex object that\ndestructs, so if the Mutex is locked after destruction, we can print out\nits name to aid debugging. This is only available when compiled with\nDEBUG_THREADS. Enabling this variable will cause a memory leak, so you",
