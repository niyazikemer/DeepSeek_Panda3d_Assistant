That\n        is, frontPart is reparented to backPart, and backPart is\n        reordered to appear first among its siblings.\n\n        If mode == -2, the geometry is arranged to be drawn in the\n        correct order, and depth test/write is turned off for\n        frontPart.\n\n        If mode == -3, frontPart is drawn as a decal onto backPart.\n        This assumes that frontPart is mostly coplanar with and does\n        not extend beyond backPart, and that backPart is mostly flat\n        (not self-occluding).",
