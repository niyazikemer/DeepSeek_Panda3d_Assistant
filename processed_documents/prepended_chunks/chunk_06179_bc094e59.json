  "content": "This chunk introduces the concept of particle factories in Panda3D, which are used to generate particles with specific properties and behaviors. Factories define how particles are created and their initial characteristics, such as lifespan, mass, and velocity. The section explains two types of factories: PointParticleFactory for default rotation and ZspinParticleFactory for spinning along the Z-axis. Following this chunk, the document continues by describing emitters, which control where and how particles are released into the system.\n\nFactory\n\nParticles are generated in this stage using the provided parameters. Panda3D Provides 2 Factories:\n\nPointParticleFactory: Generates particles with default rotation.\n\nZspinParticleFactory: Generates particles which spin along their Z-axis. This is kind of an intermediary class- if you're using a SpriteParticleRenderer and you want your sprites to spin without having them be full-blown oriented (i.e. angry quat math), use this. Note: 'set_final_angle' and 'angular_velocity' are mutually exclusive APIs if angular-velocity is specified, final_angle is ignored.\n\nPT(PointParticleFactory) pt_particle_factory = new PointParticleFactory();\npt_particle_factory->set_lifespan_base(0.5);\npt_particle_factory->set_lifespan_spread(0);\npt_particle_factory->set_mass_base(1.0);\npt_particle_factory->set_mass_spread(0);\npt_particle_factory->set_terminal_velocity_base(400);\npt_particle_factory->set_terminal_velocity_spread(0);\n\nEmitter",
