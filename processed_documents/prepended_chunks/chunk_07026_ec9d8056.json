  "content": "The chunk describes the fundamental concepts of texture modes in Panda3D, including how different types of textures (color, normal, gloss, glow) are applied and combined using TextureStage.set_mode(). It provides an overview of how to control texture application methods like modulate, decal, blend, etc., through the same function. The section serves as a foundational guide for understanding how textures influence model appearance in 3D scenes.\n\nTexture Modes\n\nThere are several kinds of textures: color textures, normal maps, gloss maps, glow maps, and so forth. To distinguish these, use the .TextureStage.set_mode() function.\n\nFuthermore, within the general category of color textures, there are several ways to combine the colors: Modulate, Decal, Blend, and so forth. These, too, are controlled using the ~.TextureStage.set_mode() function.\n\nThe Basics\n\nLet's go back to the example of applying a texture to the smiley model. In this case, we'll create a new TextureStage to apply the following texture image:\n\nTo this scene:",
