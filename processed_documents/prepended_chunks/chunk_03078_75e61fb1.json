These methods allow users to control and query the timing aspects of animations, ensuring proper synchronization and providing essential information for animation management across various levels of detail (LODs).\n\nIt used to be legal to let the animName default to the\n        currently-playing anim, but this was confusing and could lead\n        to the wrong anim's play rate getting set.  Better to insist\n        on this parameter.\n        NOTE: sets play rate on all LODs\"\"\"\n        for control in self.getAnimControls(animName, partName):\n            control.setPlayRate(rate)\n\n    def getDuration(self, animName=None, partName=None,\n                    fromFrame=None, toFrame=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return duration of given anim name and given part.\n        If no anim specified, use the currently playing anim.\n        If no part specified, return anim duration of first part.\n        NOTE: returns info for arbitrary LOD\n        \"\"\"\n        lodName = next(iter(self.__animControlDict))\n        controls = self.getAnimControls(animName, partName)\n        if len(controls) == 0:\n            return None",
