  "content": "This chunk describes configuration options related to the Bullet physics engine, including damping parameters, broadphase algorithms, and contact events. It is situated within a larger document detailing various Panda3D settings and configurations. The context explains how these Bullet-specific parameters affect simulation accuracy and performance.\n\njitter. Default value is FALSE. Additional damping is an experimental\nfeature of the Bullet physics engine. Use with care. bullet-additional-damping-angular-factor double 0.01 Only used when bullet-additional-damping is set to TRUE. Default\nvalue is 0.01 bullet-additional-damping-angular-threshold double 0.01 Only used when bullet-additional-damping is set to TRUE. Default\nvalue is 0.01. bullet-additional-damping-linear-factor double 0.005 Only used when bullet-additional-damping is set to TRUE. Default\nvalue is 0.005 bullet-additional-damping-linear-threshold double 0.01 Only used when bullet-additional-damping is set to TRUE. Default\nvalue is 0.01 bullet-broadphase-algorithm enum aabb Specifies the broadphase algorithm to be used by the physics engine.\nDefault value is 'aabb' (dynamic aabb tree). bullet-enable-contact-events bool 0 Specifies if events should be send when new contacts are created or\nexisting contacts get remove.
