  "content": "This chunk is situated within the documentation of the `draw_in_front` method in the `Actor` class. The method controls the rendering order of actor parts, placing specific geometry in different bins to achieve front-to-back ordering effects.\n\nIf mode > 0, the frontPart geometry is placed in the 'fixed'\n        bin, with the indicated drawing order.  This will cause it to\n        be drawn after almost all other geometry.  In this case, the\n        backPartName is actually unused.",
