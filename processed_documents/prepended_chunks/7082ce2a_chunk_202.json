  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of the implementation details for the `OpenGLPandaWindow` class in a Python application that integrates Panda3D with wxWidgets for creating OpenGL-based windows. The chunk checks if the `GLCanvas` class is available in the `wxgl` module, which is necessary for rendering graphics using OpenGL within a wxWidgets application. If `GLCanvas` is not available, it sets `OpenGLPandaWindow` to `None`, indicating that this window implementation cannot be used. This conditional check ensures compatibility and proper fallback mechanisms when working with different platforms or configurations.\n\nif not hasattr(wxgl, 'GLCanvas'):\n    OpenGLPandaWindow = None\nelse:\n    class OpenGLPandaWindow(wxgl.GLCanvas):  # type: ignore[no-redef]\n        \"\"\" This class implements a Panda3D \"window\" that actually draws\n        within the wx GLCanvas object.
