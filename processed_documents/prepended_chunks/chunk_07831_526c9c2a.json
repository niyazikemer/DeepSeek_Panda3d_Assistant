  "content": "Creating a card node to make TextNode geometry fully pickable by embedding text in a CardMaker-generated node with DecalEffect for preventing z-fighting, providing a workaround solution since TextNodes themselves lack direct geometry.\n\ncard = NodePath(cardMaker.generate())\ntnp = card.attachNewNode(textNode)\ncard.setEffect(DecalEffect.make())\n\nInstead of parenting the TextNode directly to the scene, parent the node returned by textNode.generate() instead. This will be a static node that contains the polygons that render the text. If the text changes in the future, it won't automatically update the geometry in this node; you will have to replace this node with the new result of textNode.generate(). But this node will be 100% pickable. In particular, if you have specified textNode.setCardDecal(True), then the first child of the node should be the card geometry.",
