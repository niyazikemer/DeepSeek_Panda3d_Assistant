  "content": "This chunk of code represents the initial steps of a method in a Python class responsible for handling callbacks when specific objects (identified by their doIds) are generated. The code checks if all requested objects already exist, triggers immediate callbacks for any that do, and sets up listeners for those that don't yet exist, preparing to handle them asynchronously or via timeouts if they fail to appear promptly.\n\n# First, see if we have all of the objects already.\n        objects, doIdsPending = self.__generateObjectList(doIdList)\n\n        # Call the eachCallback immediately on any objects we already\n        # have.\n        if eachCallback:\n            for object in objects:\n                if object:\n                    eachCallback(object)\n\n        if len(doIdsPending) == 0:\n            # All the objects exist, so just call the callback\n            # immediately.\n            assert self.notify.debug(\"All objects already exist.\")\n            if allCallback:\n                allCallback(objects)\n            return\n\n        # Some objects don't exist yet, so start listening for them, and\n        # also set a timeout in case they don't come.\n        assert self.notify.debug(\"Some objects pending: %s\" % (doIdsPending))",
