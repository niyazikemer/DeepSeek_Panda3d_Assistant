The `resolveMouse` function checks whether the requested mouse mode was successfully applied, while the subsequent explanation covers enabling raw mouse input and configuring multiple mice for specific use cases.\n\ndef resolveMouse(task):\n    props = base.win.getProperties()\n\n    actualMode = props.getMouseMode()\n    if actualMode != WindowProperties.M_relative:\n        # did not get requested mode... perhaps try another.\n\nMultiple Mice\n\nIf you have multiple mice connected to a single machine, it is possible to get mouse movements and buttons for each individual mouse. This is called raw mouse input. It is really only useful if you are building an arcade machine that has lots of trackballs or spinners.\n\nIn order to use raw mouse input, you first need to enable it. To do so, add the following line to your panda configuration file:\n\nread-raw-mice #t",
