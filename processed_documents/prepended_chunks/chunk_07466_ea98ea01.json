  "content": "The note provides important context regarding assumptions made when retrieving and processing data from a `NetDatagram` using the `PyDatagramIterator`, following the discussion of message receipt and processing.\n\nNote\n\nIt is assumed that the message recipient will retrieve the same type of content in the same order that the message sender packed the content. No mechanism exists in the PyDatagramIterator to ensure that the data being unpacked matches the requested type. Unpacking the data using a different type function will probably result in unexpected behavior.",
