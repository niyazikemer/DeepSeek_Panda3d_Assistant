  "content": "# Methods for signaling completion and object representation\n\nThe `_signalComplete` method notifies when all required events have been completed by setting the `_completed` flag to `True`, sending the done event via `messenger.send()`, and then destroying the instance. The `__repr__` method provides a string representation of the EventGroup object, detailing its name, sub-events, done event, and completed events for debugging purposes.\n\ndef _signalComplete(self):\n        self._completed = True\n        messenger.send(self._doneEvent)\n        self.destroy()\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return '%s(\\'%s\\', %s, doneEvent=\\'%s\\') # completed=%s' % (\n            self.__class__.__name__,\n            self._name,\n            tuple(self._subEvents),\n            self._doneEvent,\n            tuple(self._completedEvents))",
