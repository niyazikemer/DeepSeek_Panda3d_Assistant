  "content": "This code chunk is situated within the context of an ActorInterval class's method responsible for unloading animations from all LODs (Level of Detail). The loop iterates over each animation in `anims`, retrieves its definition, and ensures any associated control effects are reset to zero and references cleared. This process prevents lingering animation influence after they're unloaded.\n\n**Succinct Context:**\n\nThe code is part of the ActorInterval class's method for unloading animations across all LODs. It resets each animation's effect to zero and clears their controls, ensuring no residual influence remains post-unload.\n\nfor anim in anims:\n                        animDef = self.__animControlDict[lodName][partName].get(anim)\n                        if animDef and animDef.animControl is not None:\n                            # Try to clear any control effects before we let\n                            # our handle on them go. This is especially\n                            # important if the anim control was blending\n                            # animations.\n                            animDef.animControl.getPart().setControlEffect(animDef.animControl, 0.0)\n                            animDef.animControl = None",
