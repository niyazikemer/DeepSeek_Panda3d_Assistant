  "content": "The chunk describes the core `DistributedSmoothNodeBase` class and its initialization methods from a Python module focused on networked smooth node updates in a Panda3D application. The class provides functionality for broadcasting position and heading data over a distributed system, including setup, cleanup, and smoothing operations. It includes the initial class definition, nested `BroadcastTypes` enum, constructor (`__init__`), initialization (`generate`), cleanup (`disable`, `delete`), and clearing smoothing state methods. This chunk forms the foundation of the distributed smooth node implementation, setting up key properties and behaviors for subsequent position/heading broadcasting functionality.\n\nclass DistributedSmoothNodeBase:\n    \"\"\"common base class for DistributedSmoothNode and DistributedSmoothNodeAI\n    \"\"\"\n\n    class BroadcastTypes(IntEnum):\n        FULL = 0\n        XYH = 1\n        XY = 2\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.__broadcastPeriod = None\n\n    def generate(self):\n        self.cnode = CDistributedSmoothNodeBase()\n        self.cnode.setClockDelta(globalClockDelta)\n        self.d_broadcastPosHpr = None\n\n    def disable(self):\n        del self.cnode\n        # make sure our task is gone\n        self.stopPosHprBroadcast()\n\n    def delete(self):\n        pass\n\n    def b_clearSmoothing(self):\n        self.d_clearSmoothing()\n        self.clearSmoothing()\n\n    def d_clearSmoothing(self):\n        self.sendUpdate(\"clearSmoothing\", [0])\n\n    ### posHprBroadcast ###\n\n    def getPosHprBroadcastTaskName(self):\n        # presumably, we have a doId at this point\n        return \"sendPosHpr-%s\" % self.doId",
