  "content": "This chunk introduces the **Bullet Character Controller** within the Panda3D framework, explaining its purpose in providing smooth character movement mechanics typically found in first-person shooters or role-playing games. It highlights the controller's role as a kinematic object for precise control over player/NPC movement and provides an overview of setting it up using Python or C++ code examples. The context also notes that this is an early-stage feature with limitations, such as improper interaction with dynamic bodies in Bullet physics engine.\n\nBullet Character Controller\n\nBullet comes with a simple character controller already included. A character controller is a class intended to provide a simple way of controlling a player (or NPC) object the way we are used to from many first-person-shooters or role-playing-games. Achieving satisfying results for character movement is usually a difficult thing when using \"physicals\", e. g. rigid bodies. The solution is to use so-called \"kinematic\" objects, that is objects which don't respond to forces, and instead get moved by pushing/turning them around by hand.\n\nNotice: The module panda3d.bullet doesn't implement it's own character controller. It simple exposes the character controller which comes with the Bullet physics engine. This character controller is still in an early stage, and it lacks a few features. In particular, Bullet does not implement a proper interaction between dynamic bodies and the character controller.\n\nSetup",
