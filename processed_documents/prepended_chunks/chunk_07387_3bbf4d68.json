  "content": "The provided chunk is part of a comprehensive guide explaining various collision solids in Panda3D. It details the CollisionRay, CollisionLine, CollisionSegment, CollisionParabola, and CollisionBox, including their constructors and usage. This section follows an introduction to other collision solids like FloorMesh, InvSphere, Plane, and Polygon, and precedes a summary table listing which solids can be used as \"from\" or \"into\" objects. The context is within the detailed explanation of each collision solid type, allowing users to understand their specific uses and constructors before summarizing their roles in the collision system.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe chunk describes several collision detection primitives\u2014CollisionRay, CollisionLine, CollisionSegment, CollisionParabola, and CollisionBox\u2014in Panda3D, explaining their constructors and usage. It is situated within a detailed explanation of each type after an introduction to other \"into\" solids like FloorMesh, InvSphere, Plane, and Polygon, and before a table summarizing their roles as \"from\" or \"into\" objects in collision detection.\n\nA CollisionRay is created by specifing an origin point, and a direction vector. The direction vector need not be normalized.\n\nray = CollisionRay(ox, oy, oz, dx, dy, dz)\n\nCollisionLine\n\nThis is essentially the same as a CollisionRay, except it extends to infinity in both directions. It is constructed with the same parameters, an origin point and a direction vector.\n\nline = CollisionLine(ox, oy, oz, dx, dy, dz)\n\nCollisionSegment\n\nA segment is another variant on the CollisionRay that does not extend to infinity, but only goes to a certain point and stops. It is useful when you want to put a limit on how far the CollisionRay would otherwise reach.\n\nA CollisionSegment is constructed by specifying the two end points.\n\nsegment = CollisionSegment(ax, ay, az, bx, by, bz)\n\nCollisionParabola\n\nA parabola is another variant on the CollisionRay that bends. It is useful when you want to test with arcs, such as a cannonball shot.\n\nCollisionBox",
