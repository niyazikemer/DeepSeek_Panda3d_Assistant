  "content": "The chunk describes how to enable M_multisample transparency mode in Panda3D, which avoids depth-sorting issues but requires high-end graphics hardware. It explains that this can be done by adding the keyword \"ms\" via egg- palettize or manually editing egg files for specific textures.\n\nContext: Enabling M_multisample Transparency Mode in Panda3D\nTo enable M_multisample transparency mode, which bypasses depth-sorting issues but necessitates high-end graphics cards, users can use egg- palettize to add the \"ms\" keyword or manually insert \"<Scalar> alpha { ms }\" into texture references.\n\nIf you use egg-palettize, you can engage M_multisample mode by putting the keyword \"ms\" on the line with the texture(s). Without egg-palettize, hand-edit the egg files to put the line:\n\n<Scalar> alpha { ms }\n\nwithin the <Texture> reference for the textures in question.",
