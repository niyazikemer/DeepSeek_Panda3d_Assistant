The methods `removeAIInterest` and `alterInterest` are used to handle dynamic changes to interests, which likely represent zones or areas being monitored by the client in a game context. These methods allow adding, removing, altering, and responding to interests, ensuring that clients accurately track relevant parts of the game world, including special cases like AI-managed interests.\n\n@report(types = ['args'], dConfigParam = 'guildmgr')\n    def removeAIInterest(self, handle):\n        \"\"\"\n        handle is NOT an InterestHandle.
