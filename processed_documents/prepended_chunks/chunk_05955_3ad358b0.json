  "content": "This chunk is part of a section discussing how to use particle effects within intervals in a programming or software development context. It explains the usage of the ParticleInterval class to run particle effects with specific parameters such as parent, worldRelative, and duration. The document also includes code examples and a reference link for further information on particle effects.\n\nParticle Intervals\n\nParticle effects can be run from inside intervals as well, using the ~direct.interval.ParticleInterval.ParticleInterval class:\n\nintervalName = ParticleInterval(\n    particleEffect,\n    parent,\n    worldRelative=True,\n    duration=myDuration\n)\n\nRead more about particle-effects.",
