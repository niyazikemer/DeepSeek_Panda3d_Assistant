  "content": "The document discusses matrix notation, specifically a 4x4 matrix with elements A-Q, and explores two typesetting options. It highlights the independence of storage order and typesetting choices, noting that \"row major\" and \"column major\" are insufficient to describe all possibilities. The need for a better terminology arises due to the lack of established terms for the four notation variations.\n\nA  B  C  D\nE  F  G  H\nJ  K  L  M\nN  O  P  Q\n\nTypesetting\n Option 1 A  E  J  N\nB  F  K  O\nC  G  L  P\nD  H  M  Q\n\nTypesetting\nOption 2\n\nThese are independent choices! There is no reliable relationship between the order that people choose to store the numbers, and the order in which they choose to typeset them. That means that any given system could use one of four different notations.\n\nSo clearly, the two terms \"row major\" and \"column major\" are not enough to distinguish the four possibilities. Worse yet, to my knowledge, there is no established terminology to name the four possibilities. So the next part of this section is dedicated to coming up with a usable terminology.\n\nThe Coefficients are Derivatives\n\nThe equations above contain sixteen coefficients. Those coefficients are derivatives. For example, the coefficient \"G\" could also be called \"the derivative of yo with respect to zi.\"",
