  "content": "The chunk serves as an introductory explanation of the 'Evade' AI behavior in PandAI, outlining its functionality, parameters, efficiency considerations, and referencing a full code example for implementation.\n\nEvade\n\n'Evade' is an AI behavior where an AICharacter will move in the opposite direction to a target NodePath or position.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JchuRRHqPUQ\n\nIn PandAI, 'Evade' is defined as :\n\naiBehaviors.evade(NodePath target, double panic_distance, double relax_distance, float priority)\n\nwhere :\n\nPanic Distance is the radius of detection.\n\nRelax Distance is the distance from the panic distance radius after which the object should stop evading once evade has been initiated.\n\npriority is by default set to 1.0 and is used when using two or more steering behaviors on an AICharacter.\n\nThe velocity at which the AICharacter evades is determined when you first create your AICharacter object using the AICharacter constructor.\n\nNote: 'Evade' recalculates the direction every frame and so is less efficient than Flee for a static object.\n\nThe full working code in Panda3D :",
