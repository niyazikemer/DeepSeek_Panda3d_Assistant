  "content": "The 'Boxing Robots' sample program demonstrates playing animations on actors in Panda3D using a Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots-themed tutorial.\n\nSample Programs: Boxing Robots\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nThis tutorial will show how to play animations on models aka \"actors\". We will base this world on a the popular game of \"Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots\".\n\nActors are specific models that come with some pre-generated animations. These animations are either available in the same egg file as the model or they are available as their own egg files. Only actors may play these animations, and actors also come with their own set of functions to use. Actors behave almost identically to models but use a different load command called Actor.Actor(). For more information on actors, please consult the Panda3D online manual.",
