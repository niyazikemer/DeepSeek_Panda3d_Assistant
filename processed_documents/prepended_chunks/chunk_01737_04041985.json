  "content": "The `blockingRead` method is part of a Python class designed for network communication between nodes in a distributed or clustered application, handling datagram-based messaging. It provides a mechanism to block and wait for incoming data from a queued connection reader, ensuring timely processing while maintaining system responsiveness during the wait period. This complements other methods in the class that handle creating and parsing various types of cluster-specific messages, enabling bidirectional communication between nodes.\n\ndef blockingRead(self, qcr):\n        \"\"\"\n        Block until data is available on the queued connection reader.\n        Returns a datagram iterator and type\n        \"\"\"\n        while not qcr.dataAvailable():\n            # The following may not be necessary.\n            # I just wanted some\n            # time given to the operating system while\n            # busy waiting.\n            time.sleep(0.002)\n        # Data is available, create a datagram iterator\n        datagram = NetDatagram()\n        if qcr.getData(datagram):\n            (dgi, dtype) = self.readHeader(datagram)\n        else:\n            (dgi, dtype) = (None, CLUSTER_NONE)\n            self.notify.warning(\"getData returned false\")\n        # Note, return datagram to keep a handle on the data\n        return (datagram, dgi, dtype)",
