  "content": "The chunk describes the methods available for controlling and querying Interval instances within Panda3D's Interval system, including pausing/resuming playback, adjusting time and play rate, and retrieving duration information. This section follows the discussion of starting intervals and precedes the introduction of query methods.\n\nYou can also temporarily pause and resume an interval:\n\ninterval.pause()\ninterval.resume()\n\nIf you pause an interval and never resume or finish it, the remaining actions in the interval will not be performed.\n\nAnd you can jump around in time within an interval:\n\ninterval.setT(time)\n\nThis causes the interval to move to the given time, in seconds since the beginning of the interval. The interval will perform all of the actions between its current time and the new time; there is no way to skip in time without performing the intervening actions.\n\nIt is legal to set the time to an earlier time; the interval will do its best to reset its state to the previous state. In some cases this may not be possible (particularly if a Function Interval <function-intervals> is involved).\n\ninterval.setPlayRate(playRate)\n\nWith this you can change the play rate of the interval when it is already running.\n\nFinally, there are a handful of handy query methods:\n\ninterval.getDuration()",
