  "content": "The chunk contains code for resetting the geometry node and updating the motion trail. The `check_otion_trail` function determines if an update is needed based on the sampling time and whether the motion trail is paused. The `update_otion_trail` function updates the trail by adding a new frame unless it's a duplicate of the existing one.\n\nThe chunk should be placed within the class after the `reset_otion_trail_ometry()` method, as resetting the geometry node is part of updating or resetting the motion trail. This ensures that when the geometry is reset, all old geometries are removed and new ones are added appropriately. The functions `check_otion_trail` and `update_otion_trail` should be inserted before other major methods like `begin_otion_trail()` to maintain logical flow.\n\nHere's how it would look in context:\n\n```python\n    def reset_otion_trail_ometry(self):\n        \"\"\"Destroys the currently generated motion trail geometry immediately.\"\"\"\n        if self.geom_node is not None:\n            self.geom_node.removeAllGeoms()\n\n    # Insert chunk here: geom_node lines and new functions\n\n    def check_otion_trail(self, current_time):\n        \"\"\"Returns true if the motion trail is overdue for an update...\"\"\"\n        state = False\n        if (current_time - self.last_update_time) >= self.sampling_time:\n            state = True\n        if self.pause:\n            state = False\n        return state and self.enable\n\n    def update_otion_trail(self, current_time, transform):\n        \"\"\"Updates the motion trail if overdue...\"\"\"\n        if len(self.frame_list) >= 1:\n            if transform == self.frame_list[0].transform:\n                return\n        # Continue with adding new frame...\n\n    def attach_otion_trail(self):\n        \"\"\"Alias of `reset_otion_trail()`. \"\"\"\n        self.reset_otion_trail()\n```\n\nThis placement ensures the code flows logically, with geometry handling followed by update checks and updates.\n\nself.geom_node.removeAllGeoms()\n        self.geom_node.addGeom(self.geometry)\n\n    def check_for_update(self, current_time):\n        \"\"\"Returns true if the motion trail is overdue for an update based on\n        the configured `sampling_time` (by default 0.0 to update continuously),\n        and is not currently paused.\n        \"\"\"\n        state = False\n        if (current_time - self.last_update_time) >= self.sampling_time:\n            state = True\n\n        if self.pause:\n            state = False\n\n        update = state and self.enable\n\n        return state\n\n    def update_motion_trail(self, current_time, transform):\n        \"\"\"If the trail is overdue for an update based on the given time in\n        seconds, updates it, extracting the new object position from the given\n        transform matrix.\n        \"\"\"\n        if len(self.frame_list) >= 1:\n            if transform == self.frame_list[0].transform:\n                # ignore duplicate transform updates\n                return",
