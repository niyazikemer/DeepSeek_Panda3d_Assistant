  "content": "This chunk introduces the concept of multifiles in Panda3D, explaining their purpose and functionality as a container for various game resources like models and textures, similar to .zip or .rar archives. It also highlights the multify tool used for creating and managing these files, setting the stage for subsequent sections on encryption, mounting, and integration with the virtual file system.\n\nMultifiles\n\nA multifile is a file that contains a set of files, similar to a .zip or .rar archive file. They are meant for containing multiple resources such as models, textures, sounds, shaders, and so on, and Panda can load them directly from the multifiles without having to unpack them first. Many games employ a similar concept of \"data\" file such as .upk for Unreal Engine and .pak for Quake Engine.\n\nThe multify program\n\nThe multify console program creates such files. You can get information about the commandline parameters by running multify with the -h option. This is how program describes itself:\n\nUsage: multify -[c|r|u|t|x] -f <multifile_name> [options] <subfile_name> ...\n\nmultify is used to store and extract files from a Panda Multifile. This is similar to a tar or zip file in that it is an archive file that contains a number of subfiles that may later be extracted.",
