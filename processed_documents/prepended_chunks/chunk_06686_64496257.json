  "content": "The chunk describes the step-by-step configuration of debugging and build settings in Microsoft Visual Studio after creating a new project to run and debug the \"Actors/Robots\" sample program using Panda3D.\n\nThere is nothing to fill in on the general panel, so switch to the debugging panel. You need to fill in the command name, the command arguments, and the working directory. For now, we will ask it to debug the Actors/Robots sample program. Since visual studio puts the project file in a subdirectory, the paths need to be preceded by \"..\" to get to the root of the panda source tree:\n\nFinally, switch to the \"NMake\" panel. Here, you can tell it what the command is to recompile panda. I use a bat file \"mkp.bat\" to compile panda. Since the project file is in a subdirectory, the command needs to be preceded by \"cd ..\" in order to get back to the root of the panda source tree:\n\nVisual studio now knows how to run panda, and how to compile it. You can run your program (in this case, the \"Actors/Robots\" tutorial) by clicking on the Debug menu:\n\nYou can rebuild panda at any time by clicking on the \"Build\" menu:",
