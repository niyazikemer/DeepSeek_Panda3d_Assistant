  "content": "The given chunk is related to texture loading functionality, specifically explaining the requirements for filename structures when mipmaps are enabled. This context would typically appear in the docstring of a method responsible for loading textures, such as `load_3d_texture` or a similar function.\n\nThe succinct context for the chunk is:\n\nDocumentation explaining how filenames must be structured when reading mipmapped textures with specific parameters for z-height and mipmap indices during texture loading.\n\nIf readMipmaps is True, then the filename string must contain\n        two sequences of hash characters; the first group is filled in\n        with the z-height number, and the second group with the mipmap\n        index number.",
