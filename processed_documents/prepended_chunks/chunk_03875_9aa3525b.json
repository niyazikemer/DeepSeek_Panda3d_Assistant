  "content": "The chunk is situated within the `addTaskChain` method of the `TaskManager` class in Python, explaining the functionality and purpose of the `frameBudget` and `frameSync` parameters used when configuring a task chain.\n\nframeBudget is the maximum amount of time (in seconds) to\n        allow this task chain to run per frame.  Set it to -1 to mean\n        no limit (the default).  It's not directly related to\n        threadPriority.\n\n        frameSync is true to force the task chain to sync to the\n        clock.  When this flag is false, the default, the task chain\n        will finish all of its tasks and then immediately start from\n        the first task again, regardless of the clock frame.  When it\n        is true, the task chain will finish all of its tasks and then\n        wait for the clock to tick to the next frame before resuming\n        the first task.  This only makes sense for threaded tasks\n        chains; non-threaded task chains are automatically\n        synchronous.",
