It sits within the `connect` method of the ConnectionRepository class, which manages connecting to a game server using various protocols (HTTP, TCP).

If not playing back, it then checks for HTTP proxies before proceeding with actual network connections.\n\n## if self.recorder and self.recorder.isPlaying():\n\n        ##     # If we have a recorder and it's already in playback mode,\n        ##     # don't actually attempt to connect to a gameserver since\n        ##     # we don't need to.
