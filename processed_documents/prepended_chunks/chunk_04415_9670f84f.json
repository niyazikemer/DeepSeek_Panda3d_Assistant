  "content": "The chunk is situated within the context of texture loading, specifically explaining the requirements for the filename string when the readMipmaps parameter is set to True in the loadTexture method.\n\n</context>\n\nWhen loading a texture with mipmaps enabled (readMipmaps=True), the filename must include two sequences of hash characters (#) that will be replaced by the z-height number and mipmap index, respectively. This allows for proper generation or specification of mipmapped textures across different levels and heights.\n\n</context>\n\nIf readMipmaps is True, then the filename string must contain\n        two sequences of hash characters; the first group is filled in\n        with the z-height number, and the second group with the mipmap\n        index number.",
