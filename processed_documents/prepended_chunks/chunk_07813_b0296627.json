  "content": "This document provides a comprehensive guide on converting 3D models and animations from 3ds Max to Panda3D using an exporter tool. The context focuses on explaining how to use the unconventional helper object-based exporter in 3ds Max for saving and configuring export settings effectively.\n\nThe exporter is somewhat unconventional in its design. Max has a menu item \"File/Export\". Panda's egg format does not show up in this menu. Instead, Panda's exporter is a helper object. This enables the exporter to save your export settings from one session to the next.\n\nTo export a scene, your first step is to create the necessary helper object. Go to the creation panel, select \"helper objects,\" choose \"exporters,\" and then click on the button to create a Panda3D export helper:\n\nDrop an egg exporter into the scene:\n\nSwitch to the modify panel. You will now be able to see the configuration settings that are stored in the export helper.",
