  "content": "This chunk explains how to use the egg2bam program to convert Egg files into Bam files by providing specific command-line parameters. It details the importance of installing textures into the model path beforehand and the implications of using different options for recording texture paths relative to either the Bam file itself or the model path.\n\negg2bam -ps rel -o bamFileName.bam eggFileName.egg\n\nHere, \"-ps rel\" means to record the textures in the bam filename relative to the filename itself; if you use this option, you should ensure that you do not move the bam file later without also moving the textures. (The default option is to assume the textures have already been installed along the model path, and record them relative to the model path. If you use the default option, you should ensure the textures are already installed in their appropriate place, and the model-path is defined, before you run egg2bam.)\n\nThe egg2bam program accepts a number of other parameters that may be seen by running egg2bam -h.",
