  "content": "The chunk is situated within a section of the document that discusses the installation and setup of the MayaPanda exporter tool. It provides specific details about how textures can be merged in Maya based on certain conditions, such as identical UV mappings and common filename prefixes, and explains how objects can be flagged for collision detection using a provided MEL script. This information is essential for users who want to optimize their model exports from Maya to Panda3D by ensuring proper texture handling and object flagging for physics interactions.\n\nMerging Textures\n\nThe Maya exporter may try to merge textures. For example, if your model has an RGB color map, and a black-and-white opacity map, then the exporter will consider loading them together as a single RGBA texture.\n\nIn order to merge two textures, the following rules must be satisfied:\n\nTheir UV mappings must be identical.\n\nTheir filenames must have a common prefix.\n\nBy \"common prefix,\" I mean that the files \"house-color.jpg\" and \"house-opacity.jpg\" can be merged, because they both start with the common prefix \"house-\". A common prefix consists of a series of alphanumeric characters followed by a dash. If you do not want two files merged, use a different file naming convention.\n\nFlagging Objects from Maya\n\nThe Maya exporter is able to automatically flag objects for collisions if the objects are flagged properly in Maya. There is a MELscript in the available in the source code that helps flag objects in Maya.\n\nInstallation",
