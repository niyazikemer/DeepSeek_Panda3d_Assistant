  "content": "This section introduces the concept of applying automatic texture transforms in Panda3D using `setTexProjector`, enabling dynamic adjustments based on node transformations each frame. It serves as a foundation for understanding more advanced techniques like interval-animated textures and projected textures, highlighting how real-time visual effects can be achieved through scene graph manipulations.\n\nProjected Textures\n\nIn a previous section <texture-transforms>, we introduced ways to apply an explicit transformation to a model's texture coordinates, with methods like ~.NodePath.set_tex_offset() and ~.NodePath.set_tex_scale(). In addition to this explicit control, Panda3D offers a simple mechanism to apply an automatic texture transform each frame, as computed from the relative transform between any two nodes.\n\nnodePath.setTexProjector(textureStage, fromNodePath, toNodePath)\n\nWhen you have enabled this mode, the relative scene-graph transform from fromNodePath to toNodePath--that is, the result of fromNodePath.getTransform(toNodePath)--is automatically applied as a texture-coordinate transform to the indicated textureStage. The result is more-or-less as if you executed the following command every frame:\n\nnodePath.setTexTransform(textureStage, fromNodePath.getTransform(toNodePath))",
