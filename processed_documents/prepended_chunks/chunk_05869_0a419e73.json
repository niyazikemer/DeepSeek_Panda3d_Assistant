  "content": "The chunk introduces the fundamental concepts of lighting in Panda3D, explaining how object illumination differs from real-life scenarios and emphasizing the necessity of explicitly defining which lights illuminate specific objects in a 3D scene.\n\nLighting\n\nLighting Basics\n\nIn the real world, if you put a light in a room, objects in that room are illuminated. For example, if you put a table lamp in your living room, that lamp automatically illuminates your sofa and your chair. In a 3D engine like Panda3D, lights don't illuminate things automatically. Instead, you must tell the chair and the sofa to be illuminated by the lamp.\n\nSo to reiterate, lighting a scene in Panda3D consists of two steps:\n\nCreating lights, and positioning them within the scene.\n\nTelling the other objects to be illuminated by the lights.",
