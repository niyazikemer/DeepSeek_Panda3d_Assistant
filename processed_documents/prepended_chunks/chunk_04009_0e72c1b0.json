  "content": "This chunk is part of a method that initializes and prepares textures (color, depth, aux) for use in offscreen rendering buffers. The code handles texture setup by either using provided textures or creating default ones, ensuring proper clamping for color textures. It then creates a texture group tuple to be used when setting up the render buffer.\n\nThe context involves preparing resources for rendering into offscreen buffers before proceeding with scene rendering operations (renderSceneInto/renderQuadInto).\n\nHence, the original window which used to contain the actual\n        scene, now contains a pink-tinted quad with a texture of the\n        scene.  It is assumed that the user will replace the shader\n        on the quad with a more interesting filter. \"\"\"\n\n        if textures:\n            colortex = textures.get(\"color\", None)\n            depthtex = textures.get(\"depth\", None)\n            auxtex = textures.get(\"aux\", None)\n            auxtex0 = textures.get(\"aux0\", auxtex)\n            auxtex1 = textures.get(\"aux1\", None)\n        else:\n            auxtex0 = auxtex\n            auxtex1 = None\n\n        if colortex is None:\n            colortex = Texture(\"filter-base-color\")\n            colortex.setWrapU(Texture.WMClamp)\n            colortex.setWrapV(Texture.WMClamp)\n\n        texgroup = (depthtex, colortex, auxtex0, auxtex1)\n\n        # Choose the size of the offscreen buffer.",
