  "content": "The chunk explains how to configure Bullet physics engine for Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) by setting up a \"swept sphere\" on fast-moving dynamic bodies, including Python code examples, while noting no setup is needed for static or slow-moving obstacles.\n\nBullet has built-in support for CCD, but bodies have to be configured properly to enable CCD checks.\n\nWhen checking for collision in between frames Bullet does not use the full collision shape (or shapes) of a body - this would make continuous collision detection too slow. Instead Bullet uses a sphere shape, the so-called \"swept sphere\". \"swept\" because the sphere is swept from the original position to the new position of the body. So, in order to enable CCD checks on a body we have to setup this sphere, and a CCD motion threshold:\n\npython\n\nbodyNP.node().setCcdMotionThreshold(1e-7)\nbodyNP.node().setCcdSweptSphereRadius(0.50)\n\ncpp\n\nTODO\n\nWe have to set up the swept sphere only on the fast moving dynamic bodies. There is no need to do anything for the static or slow moving obstacles.",
