  "content": "This chunk is part of a configuration file or documentation related to Panda3D, focusing on time synchronization settings, Tkinter integration for GUI operations, and trackball mouse behavior. It appears in the context of specifying variables that control auto-sync behavior after startup, synchronization attempts timing, GUI frame rate, main loop management, and memory tracking.\n\nSet to 0 to disable auto sync after startup. time-manager-min-wait double 10 The minimum number of seconds to wait between two unrelated\nsynchronization attempts. Increasing this number cuts down on frivolus\nsynchronization. time-manager-max-uncertainty double 1 The maximum number of seconds of uncertainty to tolerate in the\nclock delta without trying again. tk-frame-rate double 60.0 Set a timer to run the Panda frame 60 times a second. tk-main-loop bool true Put Tkinter in charge of the main loop. Otherwise, the GUI becomes\nlargely unresponsive on Mac OS X unless this is true. track-gui-items bool 1 DConfig track-memory-usage bool 0 Set this to true to enable full-force tracking of C++ allocations\nand recordkeeping by type. It's quite expensive. trackball-use-alt-keys bool 1 Set this true to use the command and option/control keys in\nconjunction with the first mouse button to simulate the behavior of the\nsecond and third mouse buttons in trackball mode.
