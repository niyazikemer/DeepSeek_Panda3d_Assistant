  "content": "This chunk is found within a section discussing the implementation of steering and engine/brake controls for a vehicle in the Bullet physics engine, specifically within a guide on using Bullet Vehicles in Panda3D for game development. The context explains different approaches to controlling a vehicle's movement, including steering angle adjustments, engine force application, and brake control.\n\nRelaxing the steering angle to zero if the user does no hold down the left or right keys.\n\nReducing the maximum steering angle with increasing vehicle speed.\n\nSetting engine force based on an analogue input, or alternatively based on the duration of the forward key being pressed down.\n\nHowever, it is up to you do invent such controls. What Bullet requires is that you provide the steering angle and the engine and brake force.",
