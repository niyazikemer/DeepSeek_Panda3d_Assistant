  "content": "The chunk provides an introduction to simple texturing, explaining what texture maps are and their importance in 3D modeling. The document continues by discussing how these textures are applied using texture coordinates, such as (u, v) pairs, which determine the placement of the texture map on the model.\n\nSimple Texturing\n\nA texture map or texture image is a two-dimensional image file, like a JPEG or a Windows BMP file, that is used to apply color to a 3-D model. It is called a \"texture\" because one of the earliest uses of this technique was to apply an interesting texture to walls and floors that would otherwise be one flat, plastic-looking color. Nowadays texturing is so common in 3-D applications that it is often the only thing used to apply color to models--without texture maps, many models would simply be white.\n\nThere are a vast array of rendering effects that can be achieved with different variants on texturing. Before you can learn about them, it is important to understand the basics of texturing first.",
