  "content": "This chunk sits within a section of the document that describes various configuration settings related to caching, debugging, and shader generation. The context focuses on cache-related options such as checking file timestamps, caching generated shaders, and reporting intervals, along with debug notifications for output protection.\n\nrecently changed. When this is true, the file on disk is always checked\nto ensure its timestamp has not recently changed; and if it has, the\nin-memory cache is automatically invalidated and the file is reloaded\nfrom disk. This is not related to on-disk caching via model-cache-dir,\nwhich always checks the timestamps. cache-generated-shaders bool 1 Set this true to cause all generated shaders to be cached in memory.\nThis is useful to prevent unnecessary recompilation. cache-report bool 0 cache-report-interval double 5.0 cg-glsl-version string If this is set, it forces the Cg compiler to generate GLSL code\nconforming to the given GLSL version when using the glslv, glslf or\nglslg profiles. Use this when you are having problems with these\nprofiles. Example values are 120 or 150. check-debug-notify-protect bool 0 Set true to issue a warning message if a debug or spam notify output",
