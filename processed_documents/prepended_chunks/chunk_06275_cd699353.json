  "content": "This section discusses an advanced technique for handling transparency issues in Panda3D by explicitly controlling the rendering order of transparent objects as a last-resort solution when other methods fail to resolve depth-sorting problems.\n\nA final option is to make explicit sorting requests to Panda. This is often the last resort because it is more difficult, and doesn't generalize well, but it does have the advantage of not adding additional performance penalties to your scene. It only works well when the transparent objects can be sorted reliably with respect to everything else behind them. For instance, clouds in the sky can reliably be drawn before almost everything else in the scene, except the sky itself. Similarly, a big flat that is up against an opaque wall can reliably be drawn after all of the opaque objects, but before any other transparent object, regardless of where the camera happens to be placed in the scene. See howto.control_render_order.txt for more information about explicitly controlling the rendering order.",
