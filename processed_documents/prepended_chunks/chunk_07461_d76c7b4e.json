  "content": "The provided chunk discusses how to load and animate the Panda model using both Python and C++. In Python, it explains using the `Actor` class for animated models and provides an example of looping the \"walk\" animation. For C++, since the `Actor` class is unavailable, it instructs creating a custom Actor class to handle loading models, animations, and binding them with AnimControl or AnimControlCollection.\n\nLoading and Animating the Panda Model\n\npython\n\nActors <loading-actors-and-animations>\n\nThe ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor class is for animated models. Note that we use ~direct.showbase.Loader.Loader.loadModel() for static models and ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor only when they are animated. The two constructor arguments for the ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor class are the name of the file containing the model and a Python dictionary containing the names of the files containing the animations.\n\nUpdate the Code\n\npython\n\nloading-and-animating-the-panda-model.py\n\nThe command loop(\"walk\") <direct.actor.Actor.Actor.loop> causes the walk animation to begin looping.\n\ncpp\n\nThe ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor class which is available to Python users is not available to C++ users. you should create your own Actor class which at least should do the following:\n\nload the Actor Model\n\nload the animations\n\nbind the model and the animations using AnimControl or AnimControlCollection",
