  "content": "This chunk describes several key image processing filters available in Panda3D: the Ambient Occlusion Filter for adding realism to lighting effects, the Gamma Adjust Filter for color correction, and the sRGB Encode Filter for proper color encoding. These sections are part of a comprehensive guide detailing various Panda3D filters, their configurations, and usage considerations.\n\nThe Ambient Occlusion Filter\n\nThis filter adds a simple screen-space ambient occlusion effect to the scene.\n\nfilters.setAmbientOcclusion( ... options ...)\nfilters.delAmbientOcclusion()\n\nIt is important that the viewing frustrum's near and far values fit the scene as tightly as possible. Note that you need to do lots of tweaking to the parameters to get this filter to work for your particular situation.\n\nThe filter has the following keyword parameters:\n\nnumsamples - The amount of samples used. Default: 16\n\nradius - The sampling radius of the rotating kernel. Default: 0.05\n\namount - Default: 2.0\n\nstrength - Default: 0.01\n\nfalloff - Default: 0.000002\n\nThe Gamma Adjust Filter\n\nThis filter performs a simple gamma adjustment by raising the color values to the given power.\n\nDo not use this to adjust to the 2.2 gamma of a computer monitor. For that, see the below filter.\n\nfilters.setGammaAdjust(1.5)\nfilters.delGammaAdjust()\n\nThe sRGB Encode Filter",
