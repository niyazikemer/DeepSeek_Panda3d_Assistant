  "content": "This chunk is part of the documentation for the `loadFont` method within the `Loader` class. It provides guidance on customizing font appearance by specifying outline properties (such as width, feather, and color) and choosing a render mode when loading fonts.\n\nContext: Font Customization in `loadFont` Method\n\nIf outlineWidth is nonzero, an outline will be created at\n        runtime for the letters, and outlineWidth will be the desired\n        width of the outline, in points (most fonts are 10 points\n        high, so 0.5 is often a good choice).  If you specify\n        outlineWidth, you can also specify outlineFeather (0.0 .. 1.0)\n        and outlineColor.  You may need to increase pixelsPerUnit to\n        get the best results.\n\n        if renderMode is not None, it may be one of the following\n        symbols to specify a geometry-based font:\n\n            TextFont.RMTexture - this is the default.  Font characters\n              are rendered into a texture and applied to a polygon.\n              This gives the best general-purpose results.\n\n            TextFont.RMWireframe - Font characters are rendered as a\n              sequence of one-pixel lines.  Consider enabling line or\n              multisample antialiasing for best results.",
