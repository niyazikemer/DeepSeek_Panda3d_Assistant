  "content": "The context for the given chunk is within a discussion of visualization tools in the PStats server, specifically comparing different types of charts used to analyze performance data over time or within individual frames.\n\nContext:\n\"In the PStats GUI, various visualization tools are available to help users understand and analyze performance data. Among these tools are strip charts and piano roll charts. The document explains how each type of chart functions, with the piano roll chart providing a unique way to visualize CPU behavior within a single frame.\"\n\nUnlike a strip chart, a piano roll chart does not show trends; the chart shows only the current frame's data. The horizontal axis shows time within the frame, and the individual collectors are stacked up in an arbitrary ordering along the vertical axis.\n\nThe time spent within the frame is drawn from left to right; at any given time, the collector(s) that are active will be drawn with a horizontal bar. You can observe the CPU behavior within a frame by reading the graph from left to right. You may find it useful to select \"pause\" from the Speed pulldown menu to freeze the graph on just one frame while you read it.",
