  "content": "The chunk describes essential global variables provided by ShowBase in Panda3D for Python applications, including camera control, asset loading, task management, job handling, and event processing. These variables are part of the built-in scope, offering convenience but potentially complicating larger projects. More details can be found under specific sections like model-files or accessing-config-vars-1n-a-program.\n\nA node that is set up with the camera used to render the default 3-D scene graph (render) attached to it. This is the node that should be used to manipulate this camera, but please note that it is necessary to first call base.disableMouse() <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.disableMouse> to ensure that the default mouse controller releases its control of the camera.\n\nThis is the primary interface through which assets such as models, textures, sounds, shaders and fonts are loaded. See model-files and simple-texture-replacement.\n\nThe global task manager <tasks>, as imported from direct.task.TaskManagerGlobal.\n\nThe global job manager, as imported from direct.showbase.JobManagerGlobal.\n\nThe global event manager, as imported from direct.showbase.EventManagerGlobal.",
