  "content": "The chunk provides an explanation of texture coordinates (uv's) and their conventions, which is crucial for understanding how texture maps are applied to 3D models in texturing.\n\nThese texture coordinates are sometimes called uv's because of the (u, v) name of the coordinate pair. Almost any modeling package that you might use to create a model can create texture coordinates at the same time, and many do it without even asking.\n\nBy convention, every texture map is assigned a (u, v) coordinate range such that the u coordinate ranges from 0 to 1 from left to right, and the v coordinate ranges from 0 to 1 from bottom to top. This means that the bottom-left corner of the texture is at coordinate (0, 0), and the top-right corner is at (1, 1). For instance, take a look at some typical texture maps:",
