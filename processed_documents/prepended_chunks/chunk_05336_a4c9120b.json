The code chunk includes the class definition with state constants (`UNKNOWN`, `OFF`, `ON`), initialization to set the initial state without invoking handlers, and the `goOnStage()` method that triggers state transition if needed by calling `handleOnStage()`.\n\nclass StagedObject:\n    \"\"\"\n    Use this class as a mixin to provide an interface for onStage/offStage objects.\n\n    The idea here is that a DistributedObject could be present and active due to\n    simple visibility, but we want to hide or otherwise disable it for some reason.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    UNKNOWN = -1\n    OFF     = 0\n    ON      = 1\n\n    def __init__(self, initState = UNKNOWN):\n        \"\"\"\n        Only sets the initial state of this object.
