  "content": "The document explains how Bullet simulates soft bodies as deformable objects using nodes and links, similar to springs. The chunk describes the three types of soft bodies that can be created based on node-link arrangements: ropes (1D), patches (2D), and tetrahedral meshes (3D), each serving different simulation purposes like flags or air-filled tires.\n\nDepending on how the nodes and links are arranged it is possible to create three different kinds of soft bodies:\n\nA one dimensional chain of nodes, called a rope. Each node has two links, one to the previous node, and one to the next node. The only exception are the first node and the last node - they have only one link.\n\nA two dimensional mesh of nodes, called a patch. The two dimensional mesh can be closed, e. g. the surface of a sphere. In this case Bullet can also assume the volume inside the closed surface mesh should be contained, more or less depending on the setting for the pressure inside the soft body. Typical uses for this kind of soft body are a flag or cloth, or if the soft body is closed an air-filled tire.\n\nFinally a three dimensional mesh made up from tetrahedrons. For this kind of soft body a surface mesh is not enough. The whole volume of the body has to be composed from small tetrahedrons.",
