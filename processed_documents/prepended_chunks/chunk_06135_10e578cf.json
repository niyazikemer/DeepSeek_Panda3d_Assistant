  "content": "The provided chunk is situated within the documentation of various Panda3D filters, specifically discussing two distinct sections. The first part pertains to the Exposure Adjust Filter, which is utilized in conjunction with High Dynamic Range (HDR) rendering to adjust scene luminance based on f-stop values. This section explains how exposure adjustments work and provides code examples for setting and removing the filter. Following this, the chunk transitions into an explanation of the MSAA Filter, a feature introduced in Panda3D 1.10.13 that enables multisample antialiasing on offscreen buffers, offering advantages over main window settings and advising against redundant configurations to optimize GPU memory usage.\n\n**Context:**  \nThe chunk is found within the document's discussion of advanced rendering techniques, immediately following the HDR filter section. It first explains how to adjust scene exposure using f-stops with the Exposure Adjust Filter and then introduces the MSAA Filter as a method for enhancing image quality through antialiasing without affecting system settings.\n\nThe value is in f-stops, meaning that a value of 0 resulting in no adjustment, and each value above 0 doubles the scene luminance, whereas each value below 0 halves it.\n\nfilters.setExposureAdjust(0)\nfilters.delExposureAdjust()\n\nThis filter is available as of Panda3D 1.10.7.\n\nThe MSAA Filter\n\nThis is not really a \"filter\" as such, but just a way to enable multisample antialiasing on the offscreen buffer. Doing this has a couple of advantages compared to enabling multisample filtering on the main window, such as the fact that you can switch this setting based on detected capabilities and user settings, without having to reopen the window.\n\nWhen using this setting, it is recommended to leave multisample filtering off on the main window, otherwise it will be a waste of GPU memory. So, do not put framebuffer-multisample in your Config.prc file.\n\nThis filter is available as of Panda3D 1.10.13.",
