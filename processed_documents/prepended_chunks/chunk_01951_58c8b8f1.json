It is executed after building the application for a specific platform and before creating installers. The purpose of this code is to write application icons into the appropriate directories within the build directory, specifically targeting Android's resource structure by generating icons of various sizes in different mipmap folders. This step ensures that the application has correctly sized icons for display on devices with varying screen densities when packaged as an APK.\n\nThe context involves handling platform-specific icon placement during the application packaging process, ensuring compatibility and proper visual representation across different Android devices.\n\n# Write out the icons to the res directory.\n                for appname, icon in self.icon_objects.items():\n                    if appname == '*' or (appname == self.macos_main_app and '*' not in self.icon_objects):\n                        # Conventional name for icon on Android.\n                        basename = 'ic_launcher.png'\n                    else:\n                        basename = f'ic_{appname}.png'\n\n                    res_dir = os.path.join(build_dir, 'res')\n                    icon.writeSize(48, os.path.join(res_dir, 'mipmap-mdpi-v4', basename))\n                    icon.writeSize(72, os.path.join(res_dir, 'mipmap-hdpi-v4', basename))\n                    icon.writeSize(96, os.path.join(res_dir, 'mipmap-xhdpi-v4', basename))\n                    icon.writeSize(144, os.path.join(res_dir, 'mipmap-xxhdpi-v4', basename))",
