  "content": "The document discusses various methods for optimizing texture memory usage in Panda3D, including runtime compression, pre-compressed formats like TXO and DDS, and a compromise solution using the texture cache.\n\nTexture cache\n\nThere is a compromise between dynamic compression and pre-compressed textures: you can ask Panda to compress textures on the fly, and then save the resulting compressed image to a TXO file on disk. The next time you load that particular texture, it will load quickly from its TXO file. Since the TXO file was generated by the user's graphics driver, it will presumably use a supported compression algorithm.\n\nTo enable this feature, simply insert the following lines in your Config.prc file:\n\ncompressed-textures 1\nmodel-cache-dir /c/temp/panda-cache\nmodel-cache-compressed-textures 1\n\nWhere model-cache-dir specifies any folder on the disk (it will be created if it doesn't already exist). Note that the model-cache-dir may already be specified; the default distribution of Panda specifies a model-cache to speed up loading bam files.",
