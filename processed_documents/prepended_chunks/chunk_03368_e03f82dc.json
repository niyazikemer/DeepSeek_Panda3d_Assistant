  "content": "The provided code chunk appears to be part of a larger document detailing a class or module that sets up and manages a 3D scene or game environment. The context involves initializing core components such as camera controls, display regions, lighting, and grids for interacting with 3D objects. This setup is essential for handling user input, rendering, and manipulating objects within the scene.\n\nThe code chunk initializes several key components:\n\n1. **DisplayRegionList**: Manages multiple display regions or cameras.\n2. **DirectCameraControl and DirectManipulationControl**: Handle camera movement and object manipulation in 3D space.\n3. **Grid**: Provides a visual reference for positioning objects.\n4. **Lights**: Sets up default lighting but turns them off initially.\n\nThe code is likely part of a larger class or module responsible for setting up the core functionality of a 3D scene or game engine, enabling interaction with 3D objects through mouse controls and camera perspectives.\n\nself.drList = DisplayRegionList()\n        self.iRayList = [x.iRay for x in self.drList]\n        self.dr = self.drList[0]\n        self.win: GraphicsWindow = base.win\n        self.camera = base.camera\n        self.cam = base.cam\n        self.camNode = base.camNode\n        self.trueCamera = self.camera\n        self.iRay = self.dr.iRay\n        self.coaMode = COA_ORIGIN\n\n        self.cameraControl = DirectCameraControl()\n        self.manipulationControl = DirectManipulationControl()\n        self.useObjectHandles()\n        self.grid = DirectGrid()\n        self.grid.disable()\n        self.lights = DirectLights(self.group)\n        # Create some default lights\n        self.lights.createDefaultLights()\n        # But turn them off\n        self.lights.allOff()",
