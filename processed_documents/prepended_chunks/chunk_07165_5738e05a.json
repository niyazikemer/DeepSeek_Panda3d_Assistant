  "content": "The chunk is part of a comprehensive list of RenderAttribs in the Panda3D manual, describing attributes like texture mapping, transparency effects, and noting several undocumented attributes.\n\nTextureAttrib <texturing>: Applies a texture map to the model.\n\nTransparencyAttrib <transparency-and-blending>: Causes the model to be partially transparent.\n\nUndocumented\n\nUnfortunately, the Panda3D manual is still a work in progress: there are many aspects of it that are not fully documented yet. These attributes are not yet documented:\n\nAudioVolumeAttrib, CullBinAttrib, DepthOffsetAttrib, RenderModeAttrib, RescaleNormalAttrib, ShadeModelAttrib\n\nHowever, although the manual does not document these classes, the reference documentation does.",
