  "content": "The document discusses the evolution of shaders in computer graphics, explaining how they enable video cards to perform advanced rendering techniques without requiring physical redesign. It highlights Panda3D's support for various rendering features using automatic shader uploads. The chunk is situated within a section that contrasts automatic shader usage with the need for custom shaders when standard features are insufficient, offering resources for further learning on writing shaders in Panda3D.\n\nBut if you want to do anything else --- for instance, if you wanted to do painterly rendering, or water reflections, or lens flare, or ... well, your imagination's the limit --- in that case, you need to write your own shaders. The following sections will tell you about how to do that in Panda3D.\n\nshader-basics list-of-glsl-inputs list-of-cg-inputs coordinate-spaces known-shader-issues shader-generator compute-shaders cg-shader-tutorial/index",
