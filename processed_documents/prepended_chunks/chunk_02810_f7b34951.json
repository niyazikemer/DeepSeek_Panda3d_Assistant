  "content": "The provided code chunk defines the `ActorInterval` class, which is part of an animation system for controlling actor animations in Panda3D. The class handles specifying subranges of animations (via frames or time), managing implicit or explicit duration, and implementing looping behavior where the animation plays repeatedly or holds its final pose if not looping. It is a subclass of `Interval.Interval` and serves as a core component for animating actors within the Panda3D framework.\n\nclass ActorInterval(Interval.Interval):\n\n    # create ActorInterval DirectNotify category\n    notify = directNotify.newCategory('ActorInterval')\n\n    # Name counter\n    animNum = 1\n    # Class methods\n\n    # Plays an animation on an Actor.  The subrange of the animation\n    # to be played may be specified via frames (startFrame up to and\n    # including endFrame) or seconds (startTime up to and including\n    # endTime).  If neither is specified, the default is the entire\n    # range of the animation.\n\n    # The duration may be implicit or explicit.  If it is omitted, it\n    # is taken to be endTime - startTime.  There's not much point in\n    # specifying otherwise unless you also specify loop=1, which will\n    # loop the animation over its frame range during the duration of\n    # the interval.\n\n    # Note: if loop == 0 and duration > anim duration then the\n    # animation will play once and then hold its final pose for the\n    # remainder of the interval.",
