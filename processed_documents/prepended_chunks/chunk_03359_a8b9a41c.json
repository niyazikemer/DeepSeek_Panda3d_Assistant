  "content": "This chunk of code is part of the `updateGrid` method in the `DirectGrid` class, responsible for rendering a 2D grid overlay in a 3D space. The specific code block handles the creation of minor grid lines (less prominent lines) by iterating through defined intervals and drawing horizontal and vertical lines across the grid. These minor lines are spaced according to the `gridSpacing` parameter and scaled to fit the `scaledSize` of the grid, creating a structured visual guide for spatial orientation in 3D applications.\n\nelse:\n                    minor.moveTo(i * self.gridSpacing, -scaledSize, 0)\n                    minor.drawTo(i * self.gridSpacing, scaledSize, 0)\n                    minor.moveTo(-scaledSize, i * self.gridSpacing, 0)\n                    minor.drawTo(scaledSize, i * self.gridSpacing, 0)",
