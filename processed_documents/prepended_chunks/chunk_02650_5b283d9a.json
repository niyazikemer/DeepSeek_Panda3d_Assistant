  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of the `_transition` method in an FSM (Finite State Machine) implementation. It handles state transitions by first attempting to execute a from-to function for the specific transition. If that function isn't found or doesn't handle the transition, it proceeds by exiting the old state and entering the new state. The code supports asynchronous operations through coroutines and includes error handling that moves the FSM to an \"InternalError\" state if exceptions occur during the transition process.\n\n**Context:** This chunk is crucial for managing state transitions in an FSM, implementing safe state changes with coroutine support and exception handling to ensure system stability.\n\nself.oldState = self.state\n        self.newState = newState\n        self.state = None\n\n        try:\n            if not self.__callFromToFunc(self.oldState, self.newState, *args):\n                result = self.__callExitFunc(self.oldState)\n                if isinstance(result, types.CoroutineType):\n                    await result\n\n                result = self.__callEnterFunc(self.newState, *args)\n                if isinstance(result, types.CoroutineType):\n                    await result\n        except:\n            # If we got an exception during the enter or exit methods,\n            # go directly to state \"InternalError\" and raise up the\n            # exception.  This might leave things a little unclean\n            # since we've partially transitioned, but what can you do?\n\n            self.state = 'InternalError'\n            del self.oldState\n            del self.newState\n            raise",
