  "content": "The document discusses PStats, a tool for profiling and analyzing performance in Panda3D applications. It explains the client-server architecture, where clients collect timing data and send it via UDP or TCP to servers for visualization. The chunk provides details on customizing collector properties like color, scale, and units by modifying source code, requiring client recompilation. This customization enhances how data is displayed and interpreted in PStats visualizations.\n\nColor and Other Optional Collector Properties\n\nIf you do not specify a color for a particular collector, it will be assigned a random color at runtime. At present, the only way to specify a color is to modify panda/src/pstatclient/pStatProperties.cxx, and add a line to the table for your new collector(s). You can also define additional properties here such as a suggested initial scale for the graph and, for non-time-based collectors, a unit name and/or scale factor. The order in which these collectors are listed in this table is also relevant; they will appear in the same order on the graphs. The first column should be set to 1 for your new collectors unless you wish them to be disabled by default. You must recompile the client (but not the server) to reflect changes to this table.\n\nHOW TO DEFINE YOUR OWN COLLECTORS",
