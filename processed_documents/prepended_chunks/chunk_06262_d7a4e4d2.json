  "content": "This document explains how to control the render order of objects in a scene using Panda, including optimizations like state sorting to minimize hardware state changes.\n\nFirstly, state sorting is one important optimization. This means choosing to render things that have similar state (texture, color, etc.) all at the same time, to minimize the number of times the graphics hardware has to be told to change state in a particular frame. This sort of optimization is particularly important for very high-end graphics hardware, which achieves its advertised theoretical polygon throughput only in the absence of any state changes; for many such advanced cards, each state change request will completely flush the register cache and force a restart of the pipeline.",
