This section follows detailed instructions on loading, controlling, synchronizing audio, and handling non-power-of-two texture sizes for movies. It highlights performance considerations and compatibility issues, such as limited support for certain encoding formats like DV.\n\nIssues\n\nThe video texture works by decoding on a frame by frame basis and copying into the texture buffer.
