  "content": "The given code chunk contains two methods: `delete()` and `copyActor()`. These are related to managing actor instances in a 3D application framework. The `delete()` method handles instance cleanup by marking the actor as deleted and calling its cleanup function, ensuring proper resource management. The `copyActor()` method facilitates duplicating another actor's scene graph elements, either overwriting or appending them to the current instance, making it easier to reuse models without reloading. This is particularly useful for creating multiple instances of the same character or object efficiently.\n\nThe chunk fits within a section focused on actor lifecycle management and duplication, as these methods deal with creating, copying, and cleaning up actor instances in the application. The `copyActor()` method should be situated near other methods that handle scene graph operations or resource management to improve searchability.\n\ndef delete(self):\n        if not hasattr(self, 'Actor_deleted'):\n            self.Actor_deleted = 1\n            self.cleanup()\n\n    def copyActor(self, other, overwrite=False):\n        # act like a copy constructor\n        self.gotName = other.gotName\n\n        # copy the scene graph elements of other\n        if overwrite:\n            otherCopy = other.copyTo(NodePath())\n            otherCopy.detachNode()\n            # assign these elements to ourselve (overwrite)\n            self.assign(otherCopy)\n        else:\n            # just copy these to ourselves\n            otherCopy = other.copyTo(self)\n        # masad: check if otherCopy has a geomNode as its first child\n        # if actor is initialized with flattenable, then otherCopy, not\n        # its first child, is the geom node; check __init__, for reference\n        if other.getGeomNode().getName() == other.getName():\n            self.setGeomNode(otherCopy)\n        else:\n            self.setGeomNode(otherCopy.getChild(0))",
