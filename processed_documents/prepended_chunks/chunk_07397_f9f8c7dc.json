  "content": "This chunk explains how to apply different types of billboard effects (axis-aligned, world-relative point, eye-relative point) to a node in Panda3D using specific methods like `set_billboard_axis()`, `set__billboard_point_world()`, and `set__billboard_point_eye()`. It also describes that these methods are mutually exclusive and how to undo billboard effects using `clearBillboard()` or `clear_billboard()`. Additionally, it introduces the concept of axial billboards as the most common type, which rotates around a vertical axis for objects like trees.\n\ncpp\n\nmyNodePath.set_billboard_axis();\nmyNodePath.set_billboard_point_world();\nmyNodePath.set_billboard_point_eye();\n\nEach of the above calls is mutually exclusive; there can be only one kind of billboard effect on a node at any given time. To undo a billboard effect, use:\n\npython\n\nmyNodePath.clearBillboard()\n\ncpp\n\nmyNodePath.clear_billboard();\n\nThe most common billboard type is an axial billboard, created by the ~.NodePath.set_billboard_axis() method. This kind of billboard is constrained to rotate around its vertical axis, so is usually used to represent objects that are radially symmetric about the vertical axis (like trees).",
