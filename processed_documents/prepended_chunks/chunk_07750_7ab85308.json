It explains the purpose of `DirectWaitBar`, its customization options via keywords (like bar color, texture, relief), and provides an example setup. The chunk stops at introducing the example code, which is fully provided later in the document.\n\nDirectWaitBar\n\nDirectWaitBars are similar to status bars; use them to indicate a slow process gradually completing (e.g. a loading screen). It has various options for both the background bar and the loading bar that fills up as the process progresses. You can call finish() to automatically fill up the bar, or use the following to set the value (it ranges from 0 to 100 by default):\n\nmyWaitBar['value'] = number\n\nKeyword Definition Value value Initial value of the loading bar (from 0 to 100) Number range The maximum value of the loading bar Number barColor The color of the loading bar (R,G,B,A) barTexture An image to be display on the loading bar image filename or Texture object barRelief The relief appearance of the loading bar SUNKEN or RAISED barBorderWidth If barRelief is SUNKEN, RAISED, GROOVE, or RIDGE, changes the size\nof the loading bar's bevel (Width, Height) relief The relief appearance of the background bar SUNKEN or RAISED\n\nExample",
