  "content": "This chunk of code defines how forward and rotational speeds are calculated in an avatar control system. The `forwardSpeed` variable determines the avatar's forward or backward movement velocity based on user input (e.g., pressing 'W' for forward or 'S' for backward), scaled by a defined speed factor (`self.avatarControlForwardSpeed`). Similarly, `rotationSpeed` handles the avatar's rotation in place (left or right) based on user input (e.g., pressing 'A' for left turn or 'D' for right turn), scaled by a rotational speed factor (`self.avatarControlRotateSpeed`). This snippet is part of an avatar control system that manages player movement and orientation in a 3D environment.\n\nslideRight and self.avatarControlForwardSpeed*0.75)\n        self.rotationSpeed=not (slideLeft or slideRight) and (\n                (turnLeft and self.avatarControlRotateSpeed) or\n                (turnRight and -self.avatarControlRotateSpeed))",
