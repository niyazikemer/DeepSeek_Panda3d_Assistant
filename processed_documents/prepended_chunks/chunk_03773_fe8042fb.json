This enables easier integration between Python and Panda's vfs, allowing for pattern-based file matching within the Panda environment. The chunk includes the initial documentation, imports, and the first function (`glob()`) which returns a list of paths matching a given pattern by leveraging an iterator (`iglob()`).\n\n\"\"\" This module reimplements Python's native glob module using Panda\nvfs constructs.
