  "content": "The chunk introduces two advanced lighting concepts in Panda3D: setting color temperature using Kelvin values to simulate natural light and deprecation warnings regarding manual specular color adjustments. This information should be situated within a section discussing **Light Properties** after explaining basic light properties like intensity, attenuation, and shadow mapping.\n\nIf you are trying to simulate a natural light, it may be easier to set the color temperature instead, by calling .Light.set_color_temperature() with a value in Kelvin. Use a value of 6500 for pure white, a lower value to get a warmer white color and a higher value to get a cooler white.\n\npython\n\nThe color of the specular highlight can be set individually using light.setSpecularColor((r, g, b, a)) <.Light.set_specular_color>, however, this should not be done as this will produce an unnatural effect. This method is deprecated and may be removed in a future version of Panda3D. By default, the specular color of a light is automatically set from its regular color.\n\ncpp",
