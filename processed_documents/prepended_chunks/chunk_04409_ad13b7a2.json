  "content": "The `load3DTexture` method in the Loader class is part of a suite of functions used to load various types of graphical resources. Specifically, this method handles the creation of 3D textures, which are essential for volumetric rendering effects such as smoke or fog. It uses a texture pattern with placeholders ('#') that get replaced by z-height indices, enabling the construction of layered textures. Parameters like `readMipmaps`, `minfilter`, and `magfilter` allow customization of texture filtering quality, while `okMissing` provides flexibility in handling absent files. This method complements other texture loading functions, offering support for advanced texturing requirements beyond traditional 2D textures.\n\nreturn texture\n\n    def load3DTexture(self, texturePattern, readMipmaps = False, okMissing = False,\n                      minfilter = None, magfilter = None, anisotropicDegree = None,\n                      loaderOptions = None, multiview = None, numViews = 2):\n        \"\"\"\n        texturePattern is a string that contains a sequence of one or\n        more hash characters ('#'), which will be filled in with the\n        z-height number.  Returns a 3-D `Texture` object, suitable for\n        rendering volumetric textures.\n\n        okMissing should be True to indicate the method should return\n        None if the texture file is not found.  If it is False, the\n        method will raise an exception if the texture file is not\n        found or cannot be loaded.",
