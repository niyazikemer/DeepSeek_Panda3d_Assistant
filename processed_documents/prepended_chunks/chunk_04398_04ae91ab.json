  "content": "The chunk describes different rendering modes for TextFont in 3D graphics applications, situating it within the broader context of resource management for visual assets like fonts, textures, models, and sounds. The document discusses loading and managing various media types, including font rendering techniques optimized for specific visual effects such as wireframes, flat polygons, or extruded 3D outlines.\n\nTextFont.RMWireframe - Font characters are rendered as a\n              sequence of one-pixel lines.  Consider enabling line or\n              multisample antialiasing for best results.\n\n            TextFont.RMPolygon - Font characters are rendered as a\n              flat polygon.  This works best for very large\n              characters, and generally requires polygon or\n              multisample antialiasing to be enabled for best results.\n\n            TextFont.RMExtruded - Font characters are rendered with a\n              3-D outline made of polygons, like a cookie cutter.\n              This is appropriate for a 3-D scene, but may be\n              completely invisible when assigned to a 2-D scene and\n              viewed normally from the front, since polygons are\n              infinitely thin.",
