  "content": "The provided text is part of a guide detailing how to compile and run Panda3D under the C++ debugger in Visual Studio. The section explains how to rebuild the project using the Build menu, work with source files in the debugger, set breakpoints, examine data, and notes that learning Python debugging can be beneficial alongside C++. This chunk appears after instructions on setting up the debugging environment and running a sample program, providing further guidance on using and extending the debugging setup.\n\nYou can rebuild panda at any time by clicking on the \"Build\" menu:\n\nNow that you are running in the debugger, you can open any panda source file and set a breakpoint, or examine data. Of course, it may be advantageous to learn how to use the python debugger as well as the C++ debugger.",
