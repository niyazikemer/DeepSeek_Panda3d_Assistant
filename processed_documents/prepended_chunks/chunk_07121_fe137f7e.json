  "content": "The chunk is the introductory section of a comprehensive guide on integrating Bullet physics with Panda3D. It provides an overview of Bullet, its features, and how it integrates into Panda3D, followed by a table of contents outlining the topics covered. This sets the stage for detailed discussions that follow, focusing on practical implementations and considerations when using Bullet within Panda3D projects.\n\nUsing Bullet with Panda3D\n\nBullet is a modern and open source physics engine used in many games or simulations. Bullet can be compiled on many platforms, among them Windows, Linux and macOS. Bullet features include collision detection, rigid body dynamics, soft body dynamics and a kinematic character controller.\n\nThis section is about how to use the Panda3D Bullet module.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nhello-world debug-renderer collision-shapes collision-filtering ccd queries ghosts character-controller constraints vehicles softbodies softbody-rope softbody-patch softbody-triangles softbody-tetrahedron softbody-config config-options faq samples\n\nAll Bullet classes are prefixed with \"Bullet\". A list of all classes and their methods can be found from the panda3d.bullet page of the API Reference. However, the class and function descriptions are still missing.\n\nNote",
