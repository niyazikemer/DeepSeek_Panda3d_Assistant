  "content": "The section provides a detailed explanation of how to use the batch list feature within the Advanced mode of the Maya2Panda exporter. It outlines that, unlike Simple mode which handles single file exports, Advanced mode requires adding multiple scene files to a batch list before initiating an export. This allows for efficient processing of all queued items sequentially.\n\n**Context:**  \nThis section explains the use of the batch list in Advanced mode within the Maya2Panda exporter tool, highlighting how it enables sequential processing of multiple Maya scene files by first adding them to the batch list.\n\nThe last difference between Simple and Advanced mode for exporting a single file, is that it must be put into the batch list before it can be exported. The Batch List represents the order of the files that are about to be exported. To Add a Maya scene file with its export options to this list simply click Add To Batch (The other utilities in the Extra Utilities section have this same button for simplicity\u2019s sake, but the main Add To Batch button deals solely with the maya2egg tool). After you\u2019ve added any number of scene files with any of the available options to the Batch List you can then click Run Batch and the application will launch the exporter or utility command one by one until it has finished the entire list of items.",
