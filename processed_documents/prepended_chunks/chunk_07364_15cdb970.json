  "content": "The chunk discusses styling options in DirectGui, specifically image textures and frame styles, and should be placed after an overview of GUI components but before detailed examples.\n\n**Context:**\n\nThe chunk is situated within a section explaining the styling and appearance customization of DirectGui elements. It comes after introducing the basic functionality of each GUI component and precedes detailed examples or configurations, serving to guide users on how to enhance their GUI's visual appeal through images or frame styles. This placement helps users understand the available options for customizing their GUI before they dive into specific implementations.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe chunk is part of a section discussing styling and customization options in DirectGui elements, explaining image usage and frame style choices, placed after introducing basic GUI components to help users customize their interface appearances effectively.\n\nThe image is less often used. It is the filename of a texture image (or an already-loaded Texture object). It is intended for displaying a simple texture image for which you don't already have a model created via egg-texture-cards. A default card will be created to display this texture, with a bounding box of (-1, 0, -1) to (1, 0, 1); that is, a square with sides of length 2 units, centered on the origin. You can position and scale this card with the keywords image_pos and image_scale. See also onscreenimage.\n\nFinally, the DirectGui may have a frame created for it. This is typically a gray rectangular background with an optional bevel. There are a handful of different frame styles; you can use the relief keyword to select from one of the available styles; your choices are SUNKEN, RAISED, GROOVE, or RIDGE. You can also specify relief = None to avoid creating a frame polygon altogether (this is commonly done when you have specified your own geom object with the geom keyword).",
