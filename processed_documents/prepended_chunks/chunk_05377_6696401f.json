  "content": "This chunk introduces the `RelatedObjectMgr` class implementation, which manages object associations by doId, handles callbacks upon generation or timeout, and uses DirectNotify for logging.\n\nThis class helps manage that process.  To use it, an object should\n    register its desire to be associated with the other object's doId.\n    When the other object is generated (or immediately, if the object\n    already exists), the associated callback will be called.  There is\n    also a timeout callback in case the object never appears.\n    \"\"\"\n    notify = DirectNotifyGlobal.directNotify.newCategory('RelatedObjectMgr')\n\n    doLaterSequence = 1\n\n    def __init__(self, cr):\n        self.cr = cr\n        self.pendingObjects = {}\n\n    def destroy(self):\n        self.abortAllRequests()\n        del self.cr\n        del self.pendingObjects",
