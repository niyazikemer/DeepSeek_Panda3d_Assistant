  "content": "The document explains orthographic lenses in 3D rendering, detailing their lack of perspective, no field of view angle, and use cases like special effects or 2\u00bd- D looks. It contrasts them with perspective lenses, discusses film size adjustment, near/far plane settings, and provides code examples for implementation.\n\nOrthographic Lenses\n\nThe previous page described the .PerspectiveLens class, and the various properties of a perspective lens, especially its field of view. There is another kind of lens that is frequently used in 3-D rendering, but it doesn't have a field of view in the same sense at all. This is an orthographic lens.",
