The selected portion configures the widget's selection command, positions it in the UI layout, binds balloon help for user assistance, registers the widget in a dictionary for future reference, and returns the configured widget instance. This code is part of setting up interactive elements in a graphical user interface (GUI) application.\n\n# Bind selection command\n        widget['selectioncommand'] = command\n        widget.pack(side = side, fill = fill, expand = expand)\n        # Bind help\n        self.bind(widget, balloonHelp)\n        # Record widget\n        self.widgetDict[category + '-' + text] = widget\n        return widget",
