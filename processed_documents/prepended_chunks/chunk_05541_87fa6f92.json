To do this, we will have a node attached to the\n        # grid cell origin, and the object will wrtReparent himself to it when\n        # crossing into that grid cell.  We don't need to create a node for each\n        # cell origin.  We just need two nodes:  one that we are currently parented\n        # to, and the other that we will wrtReparentTo.
