This section includes warnings about the potential drawbacks of relying on these variables, particularly in larger projects, and references additional resources for further understanding.\n\nWhile these are handy for prototyping, we do not recommend using them in bigger\nprojects, as it can make the code confusing to read to other Python developers,\nto whom it may not be obvious where these variables are originating.\n\nRefer to the :mod:`builtins` page for a listing of the variables written to the\nbuilt-in scope.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\n__all__ = ['ShowBase', 'WindowControls']\n\n# This module redefines the builtin import function with one\n# that prints out every import it does in a hierarchical form\n# Annoying and very noisy, but sometimes useful\n#import VerboseImport",
