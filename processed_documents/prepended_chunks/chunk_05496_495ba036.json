  "content": "This code chunk introduces methods related to object deletion in `DistributedObjectUD`. Specifically, it implements `sendDeleteEvent()`, which sends a deletion event before an object is deleted, and `delete()`, which manages the cleanup process by decrementing a generation counter. The `delete()` method ensures that resources are properly released only when all generations of the object have been cleaned up. These methods are crucial for maintaining proper lifecycle management in distributed systems, ensuring graceful termination and resource cleanup.\n\ndef sendDeleteEvent(self):\n        # this is called just before we get deleted\n        delEvent = self.getDeleteEvent()\n        if delEvent:\n            messenger.send(delEvent)\n\n    def delete(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Inheritors should redefine this to take appropriate action on delete\n        Note that this may be called multiple times if a class inherits\n        from DistributedObjectUD more than once.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.__generates -= 1\n        if self.__generates < 0:\n            self.notify.debug('DistributedObjectUD: delete() called more times than generate()')\n        if self.__generates == 0:\n            # prevent this code from executing multiple times\n            if self.air is not None:\n                # self.doId may not exist.
