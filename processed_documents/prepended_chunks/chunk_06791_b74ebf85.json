This is just a failsafe to prevent\nthe code from attempting runaway connections; this limit should never be\nreached in practice. http-proxy-tunnel bool 0 This specifies the default value for\nHTTPChannel::set_proxy_tunnel(). If this is true, we will tunnel through\na proxy for all connections, instead of asking the proxy to serve\ndocuments normally. http-skip-body-size int 8192 This is the maximum number of bytes in a received (but unwanted)\nbody that will be skipped past, in order to reset to a new request. See\nHTTPChannel::set_skip_body_size(). http-timeout double 20.0 This is the default amount of time to wait for the HTTP server (or\nproxy) to finish sending its response to our request, in seconds. It\nstarts counting after the TCP connection has been established",
