  "content": "Film Size (E) is a crucial property within Panda3D, serving as an abstract representation to simulate the film dimensions of real-world cameras. This allows users to define the units for advanced lens attributes like focal length and aspect ratio, ensuring accurate virtual camera setups.\n\nE. This size is the film size of the lens. This is only an abstract concept in Panda3D; it is designed to simulate the actual film size of a physical lens. In a real, physical camera, the lens casts light onto a piece of film behind the lens, and the size of the film impacts the effective field of view of the lens via a mathematical formula that every photographer knows (and which I won't repeat here). In Panda3D, you will probably ignore the film size, unless you are a photographer, or you want to set up a virtual lens that exactly matches the properties of some real, physical lens.",
