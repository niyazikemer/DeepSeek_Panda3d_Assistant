It also covers metrics reporting for frame rate and memory allocation tracking.\n\nrecently been released. If a new index buffer is prepared while a\nrecently-released one of the same size is still in the cache, that same\nbuffer is recycled. This cuts down on the overhead of creating and\ndestroying index buffers on the graphics card. released-vbuffer-cache-size int 1048576 Specifies the size in bytes of the cache of vertex buffers that have\nrecently been released. If a new vertex buffer is prepared while a\nrecently-released one of the same size is still in the cache, that same\nbuffer is recycled. This cuts down on the overhead of creating and\ndestroying vertex buffers on the graphics card. remove-callback-window bool 0 When set to false, removes the callback window as stated in\nWxPandaWindow. report-frame-rate-interval double 300.0 How many milliseconds delay for each frame rate report. report-memory-interval double 5.0 This is the interval, in seconds, for reports of currently allocated",
