  "content": "The chunk describes how to configure a `DirectScrolledList` widget by specifying its items and customizing its scroll buttons.\n\nThe items option should either be a list of DirectGUI items or of strings. If strings are used, the itemMakeFunction (and possibly itemMakeExtraArgs) option should be defined to point to a function that will take the supplied string, the index, and the extra args as parameters and return a DirectGUI object to insert into the list. If items is a list of strings and itemMakeFunction is not specified, it will create a list of DirectLabels. itemMakeFunction is redundant if a list of DirectGUI objects is passed into items to begin with.\n\nDirectScrolledLists come with two scroll buttons for navigating through the list. By default, they both start at (0,0,0) relative to the list with size 0, and their positions and size need to be set explicitly. You can set any of the values except relief appearance as you initialize the list:\n\nmyScrolledList = DirectScrolledList(incButton_propertyName=value,\n                                    decButton_propertyName=value)",
