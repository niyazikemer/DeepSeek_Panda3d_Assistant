  "content": "The chunk introduces the `DirectScrolledFrame` class, which inherits from `DirectFrame`, and provides an overview of its functionality as a scrollable frame. The `__init__` method begins by defining default options for the widget, including settings related to its size, canvas, scroll bars, and border. This is the starting point of the class implementation, where the fundamental properties and components are initialized.\n\nclass DirectScrolledFrame(DirectFrame):\n    \"\"\"\n    DirectScrolledFrame -- a special frame that uses DirectScrollBar to\n    implement a small window (the frameSize) into a potentially much\n    larger virtual canvas (the canvasSize, scrolledFrame.getCanvas()).\n\n    Unless specified otherwise, scroll bars are automatically created\n    and managed as needed, based on the relative sizes od the\n    frameSize and the canvasSize.  You can also set manageScrollBars =\n    0 and explicitly position and hide or show the scroll bars\n    yourself.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, parent = None, **kw):\n        optiondefs = (\n            # Define type of DirectGuiWidget\n            ('pgFunc',         PGScrollFrame,      None),\n            ('frameSize',      (-0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5), None),",
