  "content": "This chunk is situated within a comprehensive guide to Panda3D's collision detection system. It specifically addresses two types of collision solids: Sphere and Capsule (formerly Tube). The context explains the sphere's versatility as both \"from\" and \"into\" objects, providing definitions, usage examples, and code snippets. It then transitions to discuss the capsule shape, detailing its structure and historical naming in earlier Panda3D versions. This section is part of a larger document that explores various collision solids and their applications in 3D environments.\n\nAlso, a sphere is a particularly good choice for use as a \"from\" object, because a sphere can reliably be tested for collision with most of the other solid types. The \"from\" objects are the objects that are considered the active objects in the world; see collision-traversers. A sphere is usually the best choice to put around the player's avatar, for instance. The sphere also makes a good \"into\" object; it is the only object type that is a good choice for both \"from\" and \"into\" objects.\n\nA sphere is defined in terms of a center and a radius. Note that, like any object, the sphere's coordinates are defined in the sphere's own coordinate space, so that often the center is (0, 0, 0).\n\nsphere = CollisionSphere(cx, cy, cz, radius)\n\nCollisionCapsule\n\nA \"capsule\" is a cylinder with hemispherical endcaps, also known as a spherocylinder. Note that before Panda3D 1.10, this shape was called \"CollisionTube\", and this name remains as an alias for backward compatibility.",
