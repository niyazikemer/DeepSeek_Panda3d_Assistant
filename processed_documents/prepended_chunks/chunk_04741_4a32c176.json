  "content": "The provided code is part of a system designed to detect various types of memory leaks within a software application. The chunk at hand contains import statements and a module-level docstring that set up the necessary dependencies and describe the overall purpose of the file. This includes importing modules like `ConfigVariableBool` for configuration handling, `MemoryUsage` for tracking memory usage, and others related to task management, messaging, and garbage collection. These imports are essential for defining classes such as `TaskLeakDetector`, which monitor tasks, message listeners, and objects in the application to ensure there are no leaks, thus maintaining optimal performance and preventing memory bloat.\n\nThe context is that this code is part of a larger system responsible for leak detection, and the chunk provides foundational setup and documentation necessary for understanding how the rest of the module operates.\n\n\"\"\"Contains objects that report different types of leaks to the\nContainerLeakDetector.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom panda3d.core import ConfigVariableBool, MemoryUsage\nfrom direct.showbase.DirectObject import DirectObject\nfrom direct.showbase.PythonUtil import safeTypeName, typeName, uniqueName, serialNum\nfrom direct.showbase.Job import Job\nfrom direct.showbase.JobManagerGlobal import jobMgr\nfrom direct.showbase.MessengerGlobal import messenger\nfrom direct.task.TaskManagerGlobal import taskMgr\nimport gc\nimport builtins",
