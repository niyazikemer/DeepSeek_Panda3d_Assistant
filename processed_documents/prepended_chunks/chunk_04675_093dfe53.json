  "content": "This function `printNumberedTypes` is part of a suite of utility functions designed to aid in debugging, profiling, and inspecting data types within a Python application. The function generates output that lists the type of each item in a given list, assigning each item a sequential number starting from zero. This tool is particularly useful for quickly identifying patterns or anomalies in data types across large datasets (up to 5000 items by default), making it easier to debug and analyze data flows within an application.\n\n**Context:** The function fits into a collection of tools aimed at improving code introspection, debugging, and performance analysis.\n\ndef printNumberedTypes(items, maxLen=5000):\n    \"\"\"print out the type of each item of the list on its own line,\n    with each item numbered on the left from zero\"\"\"\n    for result in printNumberedTypesGen(items, maxLen):\n        yield result",
