  "content": "The document describes a loader class with methods for asynchronously loading and managing various types of resources such as models, fonts, textures, cube maps, sounds (both SFX and music), and shaders. The chunk explains the error-handling behavior when loading model files, specifically regarding the `okMissing` parameter, which determines whether an error is raised or a None value is returned if a model cannot be loaded.\n\nThe chunk should be situated within the docstring for the `loadModel` method to clarify its error-handling behavior based on the `okMissing` flag. This will improve search retrieval by associating the chunk with the specific context of model loading and error handling in the loader class.\n\nIf okMissing is True, None is returned if the model is not\n        found or cannot be read, and no error message is printed.\n        Otherwise, an `IOError` is raised if the model is not found or\n        cannot be read (similar to attempting to open a nonexistent\n        file).  (If modelPath is a list of filenames, then `IOError`\n        is raised if *any* of the models could not be loaded.)",
