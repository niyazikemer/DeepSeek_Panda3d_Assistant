Normally, however, you should not need to access these NodePaths directly.\n\nThe following are the DirectGui keywords that are specific to a DirectButton. (These are in addition to the generic DirectGui keywords described on the previous page <directgui>.)\n\nKeyword Definition Value command Command the button performs when clicked Function extraArgs Extra arguments to the function specified in command [Extra Arguments] commandButtons Which mouse button must be clicked to do the command LMB, MMB, or RMB rolloverSound The sound made when the cursor rolls over the button AudioSound instance clickSound The sound made when the cursor clicks on the button AudioSound instance pressEffect Whether or not the button sinks in when clicked <0 or 1> state Whether or not the button is disabled DGG.NORMAL or DGG.DISABLED",
