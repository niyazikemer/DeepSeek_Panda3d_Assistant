  "content": "\"This section provides guidance on optimizing Python code in Panda3D by considering alternatives before resorting to writing C++ code. It suggests improving existing Python code, utilizing performance-enhancing libraries like Numpy, and exploring Cython as an intermediate option. The focus is on identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks efficiently without unnecessary complexity.\"\n\nBefore considering writing any C++ code, consider other options:\n\nSee if you can optimize your code. The Python website has a page for various performance tips. Very often performance can be improved by simply writing better Python code.\n\nThere are many Python libraries which can improve performance for certain tasks, like Numpy.\n\nThe Cython language is also an option. Read this blog entry to find out more about Cython and how it can be used with Panda3D.\n\nIf none of these options help you, you will have to write a C++ version of the bottleneck function or class and make it accessible from your Python code. This page from the Python website shows you the many options you have.",
