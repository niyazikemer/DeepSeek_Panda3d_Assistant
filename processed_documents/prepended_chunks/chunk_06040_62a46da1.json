Groups can contain vertex pools and polygons, as well as other groups. The egg loader translates <Group> nodes directly into PandaNodes in the scene graph (although the egg loader reserves the right to arbitrarily remove nodes that it deems unimportant--see the <Model> flag, below to avoid this). In addition, the following entries can be given specifically within a <Group> node to specify attributes of the group.\n\n<Group> name {\n  [attributes]\n  [scalars]\n  [SwitchCondition]\n  [Tag]\n  [Collide]\n  [ObjectType]\n}",
