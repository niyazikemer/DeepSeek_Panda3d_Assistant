  "content": "The chunk introduces the \"Pursue\" behavior in PandAI, where an AICharacter follows a moving target by continuously adjusting its direction. It explains how to implement this behavior using the `aiBehaviors.pursue()` method, defines the parameters (target NodePath and priority), and notes that velocity is set during AICharacter creation. The chunk also includes essential imports for working with Panda3D and PandAI in the code example.\n\nPursue\n\n'Pursue' is a behavior where an AICharacter moves in the direction of a target NodePath until it reaches that entity, performing a change in direction of motion according to the entity's motion.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdcbN3FLYVs\n\nIn PandAI, 'Pursue' is defined as:\n\naiBehaviors.pursue(NodePath target, float priority)\n\npriority is by default set to 1.0 and is used when using two or more steering behaviors on an AICharacter.\n\nThe velocity at which the AICharacter pursues is determined when you first create your AICharacter object using the AICharacter constructor.\n\nNote\n\nPursue's direction is recalculated every frame to handle any change in the target's position.\n\nThe actual code working in Panda3D:\n\nimport direct.directbase.DirectStart\nfrom panda3d.core import *\nfrom direct.showbase.DirectObject import DirectObject\nfrom direct.task import Task\nfrom direct.actor.Actor import Actor\nfrom direct.gui.OnscreenText import OnscreenText\n\nfrom panda3d.ai import *",
