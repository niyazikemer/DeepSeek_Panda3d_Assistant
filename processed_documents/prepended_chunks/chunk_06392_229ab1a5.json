  "content": "This chunk is part of an explanation about different types of `GeomPrimitive` in Panda3D. Specifically, it explains how `GeomTristrips` store connected triangles in a specific arrangement called a triangle strip, where each additional vertex defines a new triangle with the preceding two vertices, creating a zigzag pattern of triangles alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise order.\n\nGeomTristrips\n\nThis kind of primitive stores lists of connected triangles, in a specific arrangement called a triangle strip. You can store any number of individual triangle strips in a single GeomTristrips object, and each triangle strip can have an arbitrary number of vertices (at least three).\n\nThe first three vertices of a triangle strip define one triangle, with the vertices listed in counterclockwise order. Thereafter, each additional vertex defines an additional triangle, based on the new vertex and the preceding two vertices. The vertices go back and forth, defining triangles in a zigzag fashion.\n\nNote that the second triangle in a triangle strip is defined in clockwise order, the third triangle is in counterclockwise order, the fourth triangle is in clockwise order again, and so on.",
