  "content": "The chunk is part of a section discussing advanced collision handling for rapidly moving objects. It explains how using `LerpInterval` with `fluid=1` ensures active collisions during movement, provides tips for visualizing the previous frame's position to confirm functionality, and warns about potential issues where the system might not detect collisions perfectly despite these measures.\n\nIf you are moving an object with a LerpInterval <lerp-intervals>, and you want collisions to be active (and fluid) during the lerp, you should pass the keyword parameter fluid = 1 to the LerpInterval constructor. It is rare to expect collisions to be active while an object is moving under direct control of the application, however.\n\nVisualizing the previous transform\n\nWhen you are using the ~.NodePath.set_fluid_pos() call, and you have called ~.NodePath.show() on your CollisionNode to make it visible, you will see the CollisionNode itself each frame, plus a ghosted representation of where it was the previous frame. This can help you visually see that the previous-transform mechanism is working. (It does not guarantee that the ~.CollisionTraverser.set_respect_prev_transform() call has been made on your CollisionTraverser, however.)\n\nCaveats",
