  "content": "The document explains how to create and manage graphics pipes in Panda3D, focusing on using OpenGL or DirectX by setting appropriate Config.prc variables and accessing default or additional pipes via base.pipeList.\n\nContext:\nThis section outlines the creation and management of graphics pipes in Panda3D for rendering with OpenGL or DirectX. It describes the role of GraphicsPipe as an interface to 3-D APIs, the availability of a default pipe when using DirectStart, and methods to configure multiple pipes through Config.prc settings and base.makeAllPipes().\n\nThe Graphics Pipe\n\nThe .GraphicsPipe class is Panda3D's interface to the available 3-D API's, for instance OpenGL or DirectX. In order to create a window that renders using a particular API, you must have a GraphicsPipe for that API.\n\nNormally, there is one default graphics pipe created for you automatically when you import ~direct.directbase.DirectStart, accessible as base.pipe. For most applications, there is no need to create any additional graphics pipes.\n\nThere are two Config.prc variables that determine the graphics pipe or pipes that will be available to an application:",
