  "content": "The provided chunk is part of a documentation section that explains how to use the `startProfile` function from `PythonUtil` to profile code execution. It offers an example on how to make a method globally accessible and then profile it using this utility. This section is situated within a larger document that contains various debugging, profiling, and logging tools, designed to assist developers in optimizing and monitoring their Python applications.\n\n# call this from the prompt, and break back out to the prompt\n    # to stop profiling\n    #\n    # OR to do inline profiling, you must make a globally-visible\n    # function to be profiled, i.e. to profile 'self.load()', do\n    # something like this:\n    #\n    #        def func(self=self):\n    #            self.load()\n    #        import builtins\n    #        builtins.func = func\n    #        PythonUtil.startProfile(cmd='func()', filename='profileData')\n    #        del builtins.func\n    #",
