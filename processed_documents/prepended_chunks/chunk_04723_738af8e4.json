  "content": "The chunk is part of a garbage collection mechanism to detect objects that are only referenced by the messenger, implemented in the MessengerLeakDetector class. It sets up initial conditions for a breadth-first search (BFS) to determine if an object has references outside the messenger to prevent false positives.\n\n**Context:**  \nThis code initializes the BFS process to check for objects that might be garbage collected if not referenced by the messenger, ensuring proper memory management in the application.\n\n# add the id of the object, and the messenger containers so that\n                # the search for builtin will stop at the messenger; we're looking\n                # for any path to builtin that don't involve the messenger\n                visitedObjIds.add(id(object))\n                visitedObjIds.add(id(messenger._Messenger__objectEvents))\n                visitedObjIds.add(id(messenger._Messenger__callbacks))\n\n                nextObjList.append(object)\n                foundBuiltin = False",
