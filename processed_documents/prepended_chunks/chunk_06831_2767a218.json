  "content": "This chunk situates within the larger document detailing various Panda3D configuration settings related to rendering optimization, performance profiling, and geometry handling. Specifically, it discusses advanced rendering options such as preserving triangle strips in GeomNodes, print-pipe-types for debugging, profiling biases and spikes, and UV inversion for texture projection.\n\nGeomNodes. preserve-triangle-strips bool 0 Set this true to indicate a preference for keeping triangle strips\nwhen possible, instead of decomposing them into triangles. When this is\ntrue, flatten_strong and unify operations may be less effective at\ncombining multiple Geoms together, but they will not implicitly\ndecompose triangle strips. print-pipe-types bool 1 profile-bias string 0 DConfig profile-frames bool 0 profile-task-spikes bool 0 project-invert-uvs bool 0 If this is true, the UV's generated by all ProjectionScreens are\ninverted top-to-bottom. This used to be required to compensate for buggy\ngraphics drivers that rendered to a texture upside-down in this manner,\nbut nowadays Panda should be able to autodetect these graphics drivers.\nIf it fails to do this, you should probably set copy-texture-inverted",
