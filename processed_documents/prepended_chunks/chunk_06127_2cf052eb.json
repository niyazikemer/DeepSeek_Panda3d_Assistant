  "content": "The Cartoon Inking Filter enhances object outlines by using camera-space normals and edge detection; the chunk details its intensity and size parameters to adjust halo brightness and scale, fitting within a document outlining various post-processing effects.\n\nintensity - An adjustment parameter for the brightness of the halos. Default: 1.0\n\nsize - Adjusts the size of the halos. Takes a string value: \"small\", \"medium\", or \"large\". The reason that this is a discrete value and not a continuous one is that the blur operation involves downsampling the original texture by a power of two. Default: \"medium\"\n\nThe Cartoon Inking Filter\n\nThe cartoon inking filter causes objects to have black lines around them. To enable a cartoon inking filter, use setCartoonInk. To disable, use delCartoonInk:\n\nfilters.setCartoonInk( ... options ...)\nfilters.delCartoonInk()\n\nThe cartoon inking filter works by rendering a camera-space normal into an texture. Then, a postprocessing filter does an edge-detect algorithm on the camera-space normal texture.\n\nThe filter has the following keyword parameters:\n\nseparation - Distance in pixels, controls the width of the ink line. Default: 1 pixel.\n\ncolor - Color of the outline. Default: (0, 0, 0, 1)",
