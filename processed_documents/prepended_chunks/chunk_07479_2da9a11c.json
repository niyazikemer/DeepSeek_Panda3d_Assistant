  "content": "The chunk describes the interactive features and additional graph types available in the PStats server's graphical interface.\n\nYou can further drill down by double-clicking on any of the new labels; or double-click on the top label, or the white part of the graph, to return back up to the previous level.\n\nValue-based Strip Charts\n\nThere are other strip charts you may create, which show arbitrary kinds of data per frame other than elapsed time. These can only be accessed from the Graphs pulldown menu, and include things such as texture memory in use and vertices drawn. They behave similarly to the time-based strip charts described above.\n\nPiano Roll Charts\n\nThis graph is used less frequently, but when it is needed it is a valuable tool to reveal exactly how the time is spent within a frame. The PStats server automatically collects together all the time spent within each collector and shows it as a single total, but in reality it may not all have been spent in one continuous block of time.",
