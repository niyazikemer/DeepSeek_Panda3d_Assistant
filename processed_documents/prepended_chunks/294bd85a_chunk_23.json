  "content": "The chunk appears in a section discussing the use of shaders in Panda3D, specifically addressing when users need to write their own shaders for advanced or creative effects beyond the built-in features. The context emphasizes the transition from relying on automatic shader support provided by Panda3D to creating custom shaders for unique rendering techniques.\n\nBut if you want to do anything else --- for instance, if you wanted to do painterly rendering, or water reflections, or lens flare, or ... well, your imagination's the limit --- in that case, you need to write your own shaders. The following sections will tell you about how to do that in Panda3D.\n\nshader-basics list-of-glsl-inputs list-of-cg-inputs coordinate-spaces known-shader-issues shader-generator compute-shaders cg-shader-tutorial/index",
