  "content": "The document discusses materials in Panda3D, their properties, behaviors, and methods for handling them. The chunk introduces the four kinds of lights in Panda3D and explains how materials govern light reflection based on whether they have an explicit material or not.\n\nThere are four kinds of lights in Panda3D: ambient, point, diffuse, and directional. The ambient light only creates nondirectional light. The other three create directional light.\n\nWhen light strikes the surface of the model, it is the Material that governs how much of it reflects. The Material consists of four values:\n\nDefault Behavior and Explicit Behavior\n\nIf the model does not have an explicit material, does not have a flat color, and does not have vertex colors, the behavior is this:\n\nAll nondirectional light is reflected without being tinted.\n\nAll directional light is scattered without being tinted.\n\nNo specular reflection occurs.\n\nNo emissivity occurs.\n\nIf the model does not have an explicit material, but it does have a flat color or a vertex color, the behavior is this:\n\nAll nondirectional light is reflected after being modulated by the model's color.\n\nAll directional light is scattered after being modulated by the model's color.\n\nNo specular reflection occurs.",
