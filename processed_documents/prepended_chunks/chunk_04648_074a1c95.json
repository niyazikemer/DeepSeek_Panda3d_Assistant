  "content": "The `randFloat` function is a utility for generating random floating-point numbers within a specified range, leveraging linear interpolation (`lerp`) to produce values between two bounds. It serves as a flexible tool for tasks requiring randomness, fitting well within a collection of mathematical and utility functions aimed at enhancing programming efficiency and flexibility.\n\n**Context:**\nThe `randFloat` function is situated among other utility functions in the document, particularly those related to mathematical operations and random number generation. It complements existing utilities like `lerp`, `clamp`, and various generators by providing an easy way to generate random floats within a specified range, enhancing the document's suite of programming tools for tasks requiring stochastic behavior or interpolation-based random sampling.\n\ndef randFloat(a, b=0., rng=random.random):\n    \"\"\"returns a random float in [a, b]\n    call with single argument to generate random float between arg and zero\n    \"\"\"\n    return lerp(a, b, rng())",
