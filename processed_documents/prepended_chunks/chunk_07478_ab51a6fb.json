  "content": "The chunk explains an interactive feature within the PStats GUI that allows users to focus on specific performance metrics by double-clicking on a collector in the strip chart. This action isolates the selected collector for clearer analysis and reveals any child breakdowns, enhancing detailed insights into time distribution and parent-child relationships.\n\n**Context:**  \nThis section describes how to interact with the PStats interface by focusing on specific collectors using a strip chart, allowing users to analyze individual performance metrics in detail and understand their contribution within a hierarchy.\n\nTo see any of these further breakdowns, double-click on the corresponding colored label (or on the colored band within the graph itself). This narrows the focus of the strip chart from the overall frame to just the selected collector, which has two advantages. Firstly, it may be easier to observe the behavior of one particular collector when it is drawn alone (as opposed to being stacked on top of some other color bars), and the time in the upper-right corner will now reflect just the total time spent within just this collector. Secondly, if there are further breakdowns to this collector, they will now be shown as further colored bars. As in the Frame chart, the topmost label is the name of the parent collector, and any time shown in this color represents time allocated to the parent collector that is not accounted for by any of the child collectors.",
