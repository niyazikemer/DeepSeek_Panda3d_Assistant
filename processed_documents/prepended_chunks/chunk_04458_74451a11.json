  "content": "The chunk defines methods `setSoundVelocityAuto` and `getSoundVelocity` in a class related to 3D audio management, specifically handling the velocity attributes of sounds attached to objects. These methods are part of a system that manages spatial audio effects, including Doppler factors, distance attenuation, and listener positioning. The context involves dynamically calculating sound velocities based on object movement for realistic audio rendering.\n\ndef setSoundVelocityAuto(self, sound):\n        \"\"\"\n        If velocity is set to auto, the velocity will be determined by the\n        previous position of the object the sound is attached to and the frame dt.\n        Make sure if you use this method that you remember to clear the previous\n        transformation between frames.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.vel_dict[sound]=None\n\n    def getSoundVelocity(self, sound):\n        \"\"\"\n        Get the velocity of the sound.\n        \"\"\"\n        if sound in self.vel_dict:\n            vel = self.vel_dict[sound]\n            if vel is not None:\n                return vel\n\n            for known_object in list(self.sound_dict.keys()):\n                if self.sound_dict[known_object].count(sound):\n                    node_path = known_object.getNodePath()\n                    if not node_path:\n                        # The node has been deleted.\n                        del self.sound_dict[known_object]\n                        continue",
