This may improve caching performance, but also adds\nadditional overhead to maintain the cache, including the need to check\nfor a composition cycle in the cache. uniquify-matrix bool 1 Set this true to look up arbitrary 4x4 transform matrices in the\ncache, to ensure that two differently-computed transforms that happen to\nencode the same matrix will be collapsed into a single pointer.\nNowadays, with the transforms stored in a hashtable, we're generally\nbetter off with this set true. uniquify-states bool 1 Set this true to ensure that equivalent RenderStates are pointerwise\nequal.
