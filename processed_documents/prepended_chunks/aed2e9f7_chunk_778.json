  "content": "The chunk is part of a larger codebase that implements functionality for adding various types of linear forces to a physics or simulation system. The specific code snippet shows menu commands being added to a `forceMenu` object, enabling users to add different types of forces such as noise, jitter, friction, and cylinder vortex forces. Each force type has specific parameters (e.g., amplitude, mass dependence, coefficients, radius) that can be customized when adding or modifying the force. The code is part of a broader system for configuring and managing physical simulations or animations involving forces acting on objects.\n\n# Parameters: setAmplitude, setMassDependent, setVectorMasks\n        forceMenu.add_command(label = 'Add Linear Noise Force',\n                            command = self.addLinearNoiseForce)\n        forceMenu.add_command(label = 'Add Linear Jitter Force',\n                            command = self.addLinearJitterForce)\n        # This also has setCoef\n        forceMenu.add_command(label = 'Add Linear Friction Force',\n                            command = self.addLinearFrictionForce)\n        # This also has: setCoef, setLength, setRadius,\n        forceMenu.add_command(label = 'Add Linear Cylinder Vortex Force',\n                            command = self.addLinearCylinderVortexForce)",
