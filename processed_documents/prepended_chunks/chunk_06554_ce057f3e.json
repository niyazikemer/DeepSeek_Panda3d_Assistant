  "content": "The chunk discusses the real power of Panda3D's Interval system through sequences-and-parallels and introduces the IntervalManager class for tracking and updating playing intervals, specifically in the Python implementation. This comes after explaining the core Interval classes and their properties and before detailing how to use Intervals with specific methods like start(), loop(), finish(), etc.\n\nThe real power of the Interval system comes from sequences-and-parallels, which are a special kind of Interval that can contain nested Intervals of any kind (including additional Sequences and/or Parallels). By using these grouping Intervals, you can easily assemble complex scripts from the basic atoms.\n\npython\n\nThe class responsible for keeping track of the intervals that are currently playing and updating them periodically is called ~direct.interval.IntervalManager.IntervalManager. Normally, you do not need to interface with this class directly, but you can use it to query the list of running intervals or perform operations on multiple intervals at the same time. There is one global instance of this class, which can be imported as follows:\n\nfrom direct.interval.IntervalManager import ivalMgr\n\ncpp",
