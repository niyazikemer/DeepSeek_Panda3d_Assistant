It is similar in\nprinciple to the full-featured task manager implemented in Task.py,\nbut it has a sharply reduced feature set--completely bare-bones, in\nfact--and it is designed to be a pure-python implementation that does\nnot require any C++ Panda support, so that it can be loaded before\nPanda has been fully downloaded. \"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ['MiniTask', 'MiniTaskManager']\n\n\nclass MiniTask:\n    done = 0\n    cont = 1\n\n    name: str\n\n    def __init__(self, callback):\n        self.__call__ = callback",
