  "content": "The chunk defines two event handler methods (`handleChildArriveZone` and `handleChildLeave`) within the `DistributedObjectBase` class for managing child object location changes in a distributed networked environment. These methods allow objects to execute code when children change zones or leave their current zone, facilitating scene graph management and other parent-child interactions in a distributed system.\n\ndef handleChildArriveZone(self, childObj, zoneId):\n        \"\"\"\n        A child has just changed zones beneath us with setLocation.\n        Give us a chance to run code when an existing child sets\n        location to us.
