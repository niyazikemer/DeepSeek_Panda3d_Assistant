  "content": "The provided chunk is the initial section of a Python file introducing the `WxSlider` class, which extends the wxWidgets Slider component to support floating-point values. The docstring explains that this custom slider requires calling `Enable()` after binding events and provides an overview of its functionality. The `__all__` directive specifies that only the `WxSlider` class is exported from the module, ensuring controlled access when importing. The import statement for wx sets up the necessary wxWidgets library dependency.\n\n**Context:** Initial module setup defining a custom floating-point slider control in Python with essential documentation and exports.\n\n\"\"\"\nWxSlider Class: Extended wx.Slider supporting floating point values\n                you should call Enable() after binding any event with this control\n\"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ['WxSlider']\n\nimport wx",
