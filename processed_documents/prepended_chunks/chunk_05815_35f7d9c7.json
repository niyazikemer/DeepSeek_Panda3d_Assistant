Set this to false if you want each vertex\nto only be in use on one triangle. assimp-improve-cache-locality true Improves rendering performance of the loaded meshes by reordering\ntriangles for better vertex cache locality. Set this to false if you\nneed geometry to be loaded in the exact order that it was specified in\nthe file, or to improve load performance. assimp-remove-redundant-materials true Removes redundant/unreferenced materials from assets. assimp-fix-infacing-normals false Determines which normal vectors are facing inward and inverts them\nso that they are facing outward. assimp-optimize-meshes true Reduces the number of draw calls by unifying geometry with the same",
