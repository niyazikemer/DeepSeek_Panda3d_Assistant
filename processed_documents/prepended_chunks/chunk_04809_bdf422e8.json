  "content": "The provided code defines a series of `loadPhase` and `unloadPhase` methods within an example subclass of `PhasedObject`. These methods demonstrate how different states (Away, Far, Near, At) can be managed when transitioning between phases. Each method simply prints a message indicating the phase change, illustrating the concept of state management in the `PhasedObject` framework. This example is used to show how resources or behaviors can be loaded or unloaded as an object's proximity changes relative to another entity, such as adjusting visual detail levels based on distance in a game.\n\ndef loadPhaseAway(self):\n            print('loading Away')\n\n        def unloadPhaseAway(self):\n            print('unloading Away')\n\n        def loadPhaseFar(self):\n            print('loading Far')\n\n        def unloadPhaseFar(self):\n            print('unloading Far')\n\n        def loadPhaseNear(self):\n            print('loading Near')\n\n        def unloadPhaseNear(self):\n            print('unloading Near')\n\n        def loadPhaseAt(self):\n            print('loading At')\n\n        def unloadPhaseAt(self):\n            print('unloading At')",
