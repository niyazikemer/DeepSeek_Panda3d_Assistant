  "content": "This chunk introduces the fundamental concepts of render-to-texture, explaining how scenes are rendered into hidden buffers (textures) and efficiently transferred for use in applications like image filters and 3D effects in Panda3D.\n\nRender-to-Texture and Image Postprocessing\n\nRender-to-Texture Basics\n\nConceptually, you can think of render-to-texture as being like rendering a scene into a hidden window, and then copying the contents of the window into a texture. Such hidden windows are not actually called windows, they're called \"buffers.\" Furthermore, the data is usually not copied into the texture, it's usually transferred into the texture using a more efficient mechanism. Details aside, though, if you think of it as rendering into a hidden window and then copying into a texture, you have a pretty accurate idea of what render-to-texture does.",
