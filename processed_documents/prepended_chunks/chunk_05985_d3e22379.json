  "content": "This section provides practical advice for artists to ensure their models are optimized for efficient rendering and management by programmers.\n\n\"If there's any chance that an object will be broken apart and used as separate pieces, give each piece a separate texture map.\"\n\nNothing hurts worse than having to remap an object after its been painted, or wasting huge swaths of texture space.\n\n\"If parts of an object are semi-transparent, make sure those pieces are separate parts in the hierarchy.\"\n\nRendering semi-transparent objects is a little tricky. Each object with transparency needs to be sorted back-to-front each frame by the rendering engine. If things aren't going quite as planned, a programmer might need to get a handle on a transparent part in order to manipulate its render order.\n\n\"If a semi-transparent object is very large, or you can see through multiple layers (like a glass sphere), break it up into separate pieces.\"",
