  "content": "The chunk defines the `ClusterClient` class, which inherits from `DirectObject. DirectObject`, and includes a notification category for logging/debugging purposes. This class appears in a larger document related to implementing a distributed rendering system or cluster client-server architecture. The document describes managing multiple display configurations, connecting to server processes, handling command execution across clusters, and provides fallback functionality with the `DummyClusterClient` for non-cluster mode operation.\n\nThe code is part of a module responsible for setting up and managing distributed 3D graphics rendering or visualization systems, likely using Panda3D (given references like `base.graphicsEngine`, `DirectObject`, etc.). The `ClusterClient` class specifically appears to be used for creating client connections to server processes in such a system, handling command execution across the cluster, and potentially synchronizing actions when required.\n\nclass ClusterClient(DirectObject.DirectObject):\n    notify = DirectNotifyGlobal.directNotify.newCategory(\"ClusterClient\")\n    MGR_NUM = 1000000",
