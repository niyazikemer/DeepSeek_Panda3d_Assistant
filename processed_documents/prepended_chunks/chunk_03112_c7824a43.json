This ensures that any transformations or modifications are properly reflected in subsequent rendering or physics calculations by forcing the recalibration of bounds data.\n```\n\nif partData:\n                    char = partData.partBundleNP\n                    char.node().update()\n                    geomNodes = char.findAllMatches(\"**/+GeomNode\")\n                    for thisGeomNode in geomNodes:\n                        for thisGeom in thisGeomNode.node().getGeoms():\n                            thisGeom.markBoundsStale()\n                        thisGeomNode.node().markInternalBoundsStale()",
