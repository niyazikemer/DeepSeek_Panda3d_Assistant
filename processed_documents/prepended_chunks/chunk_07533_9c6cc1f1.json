  "content": "This chunk provides an overview of tasks and event handling in Panda, explaining how these mechanisms enable updates between rendering steps. It introduces key concepts such as tasks (subroutines called periodically) and event handlers (subroutines triggered by specific events), along with related terms like task chains, coroutines, the main loop, and threading.\n\nTasks and Event Handling\n\nTasks are subroutines (functions) that you write that get called by Panda every frame or every specified amount of time. Event handlers are subroutines that you write that get called by Panda when certain special events occur. Together, these two mechanisms enable you to update your Panda world between rendering steps.\n\ntasks task-chains event-handlers coroutines main-loop threading",
