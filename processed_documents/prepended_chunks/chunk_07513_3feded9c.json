Nik has used vertex colors throughout. The yellow of the belly, the black eyes, the red mouth, these are all vertex colors. The one in the middle has been setColor ed to a medium-blue color. As you can see, the setColor completely replaces the vertex colors. The one on the right bas been setColorScale ed to the same medium-blue color, but this only tints the model.\n\nA Note about Color Spaces",
