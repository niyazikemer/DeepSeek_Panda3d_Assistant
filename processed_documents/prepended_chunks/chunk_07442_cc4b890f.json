  "content": "This section explains how to use the `get_ixel()` and `get_ixel_val()` methods in the `PNMImage` class to efficiently retrieve the red, green, and blue color values of a pixel as a 3-component vector. This capability is essential for developers working with image data in Panda3D who need to access or manipulate individual pixel colors programmatically.\n\nContext: \n\nThe chunk provides information on how to retrieve all RGB components of a pixel simultaneously using `get_ixel()` and `get_ixel_val()`, which are methods within the PNMImage class. These functions return a vector containing the red, green, and blue values of a specified pixel, allowing for efficient color data access in image processing tasks.\n\nwill return 1.0. You can also get all the RGB information at the same time using get_xel(x, y) <.PNMImage.get_xel> and get_xel_val(x, y) <.PNMImage.get_xel_val>, which return a 3-component vector containing the red, green and blue channels, respectively.",
