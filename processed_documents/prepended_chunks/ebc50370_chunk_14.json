  "content": "The code chunk defines two methods in a NodePath class: `__handleExitEvent` which manages phase transitions upon exiting a collision area, and `__oneTimeCollide` which triggers a single frame collision traversal to process all relevant events efficiently. Together, these methods handle dynamic state updates based on user interactions or movements across defined zones.\n\ndef __handleExitEvent(self, phaseName, cEntry):\n        phase = self.getAliasPhase(phaseName) - 1\n        self.setPhase(phase)\n\n    def __oneTimeCollide(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Fire off a one-time collision traversal of the\n        scene graph.
