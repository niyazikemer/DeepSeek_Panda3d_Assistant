  "content": "The provided chunk is part of a comprehensive guide on various graphical filters in Panda3D, specifically focusing on High Dynamic Range (HDR) rendering and exposure adjustment. This section explains how HDR enables greater dynamic range by using floating-point framebuffers and tonemapping, while also introducing the Exposure Adjust filter to manage scene luminance dynamically. The context emphasizes realistic lighting effects and the importance of proper light attenuation settings when using these features.\n\nDepending on the brightness of your lights, it may be necessary to use the Exposure Adjust filter in order to prevent an oversaturated image.\n\nIt is recommended to set your lights to use an inverse square falloff attenuation (using setAttenuation(0, 0, 1)), enable the sRGB Encode filter, and use realistically bright values for your light colors to achieve the most realistic effect.\n\nfilters.setHighDynamicRange()\nfilters.delHighDynamicRange()\n\nThis filter is available as of Panda3D 1.10.7.\n\nThe Exposure Adjust Filter\n\nThis filter is meant to be used in conjunction with the HDR filter, above, in order to adjust the exposure level. In a game where the player moves between different parts of the scene with different lighting levels, it will be necessary to adjust this on the fly depending on the player's location. This is similar to how our eyes adjust to different light levels as we move between areas of differing brightness.",
