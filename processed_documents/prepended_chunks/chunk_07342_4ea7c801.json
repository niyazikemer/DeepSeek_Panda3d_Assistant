  "content": "The chunk introduces the problem of polygon limits in modern GPUs, setting the stage for discussing performance issues. The document then provides solutions such as reducing mesh counts, optimizing animations, implementing Level of Detail (LOD), normal mapping, billboarding, hardware skinning, and adjusting camera parameters to enhance rendering efficiency.\n\nToo Many Polygons\n\nEven though modern GPUs can handle millions of polygons and vertex data takes little space in RAM, there is still a limit and it's not very difficult to reach it.",
