  "content": "This chunk about aspect ratio is situated within a comprehensive discussion of various lens properties in computer graphics or photography contexts, including field of view, focal length, film size, and their interrelationships. The explanation emphasizes how the aspect ratio determines the proportional relationship between the width and height of an image produced by the lens and its importance in maintaining proper visual proportions relative to the display window.\n\nG (not pictured). The final important property of a lens is its aspect ratio. This is the ratio of the width to the height of the image produced by the lens. It is almost, but not quite, the same as the ratio of the horizontal field of view to the vertical field of view. (It is not quite this, because a perspective lens is not linear in proportion to the angle.) Normally, you will want the aspect ratio of the lens to match the aspect ratio of your window; if it is something different, the image may seem stretched or squashed.\n\nYou can set the aspect ratio explicitly via lens.set_aspect_ratio(ratio) <.Lens.set_aspect_ratio>. For instance, if you open a window that is 800 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall, you might want to call lens.set_aspect_ratio(800.0 / 300.0) <.Lens.set_aspect_ratio>.\n\nInterplay of lens properties",
