It emphasizes the importance of learning Python as the recommended language for working with Panda3D and provides an overview of Python's features, compatibility across platforms, and its suitability for rapid prototyping.\n\npython\n\nLearning Python\n\nSince Panda3D is a library, and not a point-n-click game maker, it is needed to learn Python or C++ before you will be able to use it. Since this engine's main goal is to support Python, it would be a good idea to familiarize yourself with Python before continuing.\n\nPython is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented language comparable to Java or Perl. It is available on several platforms, including UNIX, Windows, OS/2, and Mac. Python also has a large number of modules outside of the standard Python installation, and additional modules can be created in C or C++. Because it is late-binding and requires minimal memory management, it is an ideal language for rapid prototyping.\n\nThe Copy of Python that comes with Panda",
