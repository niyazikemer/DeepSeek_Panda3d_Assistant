  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a method in an `Actor` class responsible for managing 3D models and their animations. The snippet processes each part name from a list (`partNameList`) to check if it exists in a dictionary (`partDict`). If not found, it looks up subparts using a predefined dictionary (`__subpartDict`) and initializes necessary data structures for animation binding. This ensures all required parts, including subparts, are properly accounted for during model setup or animation processing.\n\n```text\nThe code chunk is part of an `Actor` class method responsible for initializing or binding animations to parts of a 3D model.
