  "content": "This chunk describes key aspects of the `Material` class in Panda3D, specifically focusing on emission, shininess, and specular properties. It explains how these properties influence an object's visual appearance and provides the corresponding setter methods for each property. This information is part of a comprehensive guide detailing the functionality and usage of materials in 3D graphics within the Panda3D framework.\n\nneighboring objects) material.set_emission((R,G,B,A)) <.Material.set_emission> Shininess This controls the size of the specular highlight spot. In general,\nlarger numbers produce a smaller specular highlight, which makes the\nobject appear shinier. Smaller numbers produce a larger highlight, which\nmakes the object appear less shiny. material.set_shininess(0..128) <.Material.set_shininess> Specular This is the highlight color of an object: the color of small\nhighlight reflections. material.set_specular((R,G,B,A)) <.Material.set_specular>",
