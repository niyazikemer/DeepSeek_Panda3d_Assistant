  "content": "This chunk is located in the section discussing how to set up a Panda3D project in Visual Studio on Windows. It provides specific instructions for configuring the project by adding include directories, library directories, and additional dependencies required for successful compilation. This information is crucial for developers setting up their development environment on Windows to build and run Panda3D applications.\n\nInclude Directories\n\nC:\\Panda3D-|release|-x64\\include\n\nLibrary Directories\n\nC:\\Panda3D-|release|-x64\\lib\n\nThen, you need to add the appropriate Panda3D libraries to the list of \"Additional Dependencies\" your project should be linked with. The exact set to use varies again depending on which features of Panda3D are used. This list is a reasonable default set:\n\nlibp3framework.lib\nlibpanda.lib\nlibpandaexpress.lib\nlibp3dtool.lib\nlibp3dtoolconfig.lib\nlibp3direct.lib\n\nThis should be enough to at least build the project. Press F7 to build your project and start the compilation process. You may see several C4267 warnings; these are harmless, and you may suppress them in your project settings.",
