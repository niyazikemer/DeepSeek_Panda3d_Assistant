  "content": "This chunk is part of the explanation of the Advanced Glow Filter sample program in Panda3D, detailing how to create a glowing halo effect using offscreen buffers and shaders. It describes the process of applying horizontal and vertical blur effects to achieve a two-dimensional blur, resulting in an additive blending of the glow effect onto the main scene.\n\nThe contents of the glow buffer are then rendered into another offscreen buffer, the \"blur x\" buffer, using a shader that does a one-dimensional horizontal blur. The contents of the \"blur x\" buffer are then rendered into a third offscreen buffer, the \"blur y\" buffer, using a shader that does a one-dimensional vertical blur. Taken together, the two one-dimensional blurs add up to a two-dimensional blur. The result is that the glowing lines that were rendered into the glow buffer are smeared outward, forming little halos.\n\nIn a final step, the blurred texture is applied to the main window using additive blending - ie, the halos are added to the scene.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
