It ensures that a specified animation name is added to the list of available animations if it doesn't already exist, loads the animation into the node path (likely a scene graph component), sets the animation as looping, updates the object's current animation state, and refreshes the UI properties to reflect the changes.\n\nif animName not in objDef.anims:\n                objDef.anims.append(animName)\n\n            objNP.loadAnims({name:animName})\n            objNP.loop(name)\n            obj[OG.OBJ_ANIM] = animName\n            self.editor.ui.objectPropertyUI.updateProps(obj)",
