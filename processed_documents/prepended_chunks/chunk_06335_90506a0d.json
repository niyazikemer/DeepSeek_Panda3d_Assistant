  "content": "The document provides various Q&A on Python tools and programming. This chunk specifically explains how .pyc files are generated as compiled versions of Python scripts to optimize module loading efficiency.\n\nUsage:\n\npunzip file.pz [file2.pz file3.pz ...]\npunzip -o dest_file file.pz\n\nWhat are the .pyc files that are created after I run the Python interpreter?\n\n.pyc files are compiled versions of Python sources. Similarly, .pyo files are both compiled and \"optimized\". As an important speed-up of the start-up time for short programs that use a lot of standard modules, if a file called \"spam.pyc\" exists in the directory where \"spam.py\" is found, this is assumed to contain an already-\"byte-compiled\" version of the module spam. The modification time of the version of \"spam.py\" used to create \"spam.pyc\" is recorded in \"spam.pyc\", and the file is ignored if these don't match.",
