  "content": "\"\"\"\nThis section provides an optimization technique for managing dynamic cube maps in Panda3D. It explains how to temporarily disable cube map rendering when the environment is not changing, allowing the application to retain the last-rendered image and conserve resources. The method involves using the `setActive()` function on the graphics buffer to control the activation state of cube map rendering.\n\"\"\"\n\nFinally, you can temporarily disable the cube map rendering from time to time if you know the environment won't be changing for a little while. The cube map will retain its last-rendered image. You can do this with buffer.setActive(0). Use buffer.setActive(1) to re-activate it.\n\ncpp",
