  "content": "This chunk is part of a method responsible for reading and parsing the contents of a Portable Executable (PE) file into memory. It sorts sections, reads them into virtual memory, and extracts import information from the file's import directory table. This step occurs early in the processing pipeline after initializing the PE file object and before any modifications are made to the file structure or sections.\n\nContext: The code is used to load a PE file into memory and parse its import dependencies, which is essential for subsequent operations like modifying exports or adding new sections to the executable.\n\nself.sections.sort()\n\n        # Read the sections into some kind of virtual memory.\n        self.vmem = bytearray(self.sections[-1].vaddr + self.sections[-1].size)\n        memview = memoryview(self.vmem)\n\n        for section in self.sections:\n            fp.seek(section.offset)\n            fp.readinto(memview[section.vaddr:section.vaddr+section.size])\n\n        # Read the import table.\n        start = self.imp_rva.addr\n        dir = impdirtab(*unpack('<IIIII', self.vmem[start:start+20]))\n\n        imports = []\n        while dir.name and dir.lookup:\n            name = _unpack_zstring(self.vmem, dir.name)\n            imports.append(name)\n\n            start += 20\n            dir = impdirtab(*unpack('<IIIII', self.vmem[start:start+20]))\n\n        # Make it a tuple to indicate we don't support modifying it for now.\n        self.imports = tuple(imports)",
