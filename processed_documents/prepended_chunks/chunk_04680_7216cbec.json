  "content": "The `SubframeCall` class is situated among other utility classes and functions designed for managing delayed or scheduled operations, such as `DelayedCall`, `FrameDelayedCall`, and `Task`. It leverages Panda3D's task system to schedule a callback at a specific time during a frame. This makes it part of a collection of tools for handling asynchronous tasks and timing-sensitive operations efficiently within the application framework.\n\nclass SubframeCall:\n    \"\"\"Calls a callback at a specific time during the frame using the\n    task system\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, functor, taskPriority, name=None):\n        self._functor = functor\n        self._name = name\n        self._taskName = uniqueName('SubframeCall-%s' % self._name)\n        taskMgr.add(self._doCallback,\n                    self._taskName,\n                    priority=taskPriority)\n\n    def _doCallback(self, task):\n        functor = self._functor\n        del self._functor\n        functor()\n        del self._name\n        self._taskName = None\n        return task.done\n\n    def cleanup(self):\n        if self._taskName:\n            taskMgr.remove(self._taskName)\n            self._taskName = None",
