  "content": "This chunk discusses the different types of point billboards in Panda3D, including world-relative and eye-relative variations, and introduces a new feature for creating fixed-size point-eye billboards that maintain consistent screen presence regardless of camera distance.\n\nLess often, you may need to use a point billboard, which is free to rotate about any axis. There are two varieties of point billboard. The world-relative point billboard always keeps its up vector facing up, i.e. along the Z axis, and is appropriate for objects that are generally spherical and have no particular axis of symmetry, like clouds. The eye-relative point billboard, on the other hand, always keeps its up vector towards the top of the screen, no matter which way the camera tilts, and is usually used for text labels that float over objects in the world.\n\nAs of Panda3D 1.10, it is also possible to create a point-eye billboard that has a fixed size on screen, no matter the distance to the camera. This can be done by specifying a fixed distance to the camera. You may also wish to adjust depth testing and sorting options so that it appears on top of other objects in the scene.
