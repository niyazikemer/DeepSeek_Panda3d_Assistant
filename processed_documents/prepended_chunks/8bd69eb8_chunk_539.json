  "content": "The chunk is part of defining object types within the ObjectPalette class's populate method. It shows how an object type named 'V Double Smiley' is added to the 'Double Smileys' group with a specified createFunction that references a default handler function (.createDoubleSmiley) and passes additional arguments (horizontal=False). This demonstrates how custom objects can be created programmatically within the level editor using predefined handler functions.\n\n# this function will be called to create the object.\n                                     # When a create function is starting with .\n                                     # it means this function belongs to the default objectHandler.\n                 'Double Smileys')",
