  "content": "The chunk discusses two storage schemes for matrix elements, focusing on derivatives of xo or xi, and introduces two typesetting notations compatible with row and column vectors. It outlines four possible combinations of these storage and notation methods.\n\nIn the first storage scheme, the derivatives of xo are stored first. In the second storage scheme, the derivatives with respect to xi are stored first.\n\nWhat to Call the Two Ways of Printing a Matrix\n\nOne way to write the four equations above is to write them out using proper mathematical notation. There are two ways to do this, shown below:\n\nNotice that the two matrices shown above are laid out differently. The first layout is the appropriate layout for use with column vectors. The second layout is the appropriate layout for use with row vectors. So that gives me a possible terminology for the two different ways of typesetting a matrix: the \"row-vector-compatible\" notation, and the \"column-vector-compatible\" notation.\n\nThe Four Possibilities\n\nSo now, the four possible representations that an engine could use are:\n\nStore derivatives of xo first, typeset in row-vector-compatible notation.\n\nStore derivatives of xo first, typeset in column-vector-compatible notation.",
