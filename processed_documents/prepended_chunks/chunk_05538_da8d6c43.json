  "content": "The `GridParent` class manages the parent-child relationships between objects and grid cells in a large grid system. It ensures that objects can broadcast their positions efficiently using 16-bit telemetry by attaching them to cell origins, which are dynamically created and managed as needed. This class is essential for handling grids where individual cells span significant distances beyond the limits of typical 16-bit coordinate systems.\n\nclass GridParent:",
