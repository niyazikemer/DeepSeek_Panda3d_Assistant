  "content": "This section provides a practical example of efficiently filling a GeomPrimitive with vertex indices using memoryview operations to create renderable geometry from vertex data. It demonstrates how memoryviews can be utilized to manipulate the index data within a GeomVertexArrayData returned by GeomPrimitive.modify_vertices(), specifically for rendering a square composed of two triangles.\n\nSimilarly, the GeomPrimitive that combines the vertices into renderable geometry can be filled using a memoryview as well. After all, the return value of .GeomPrimitive.modify_vertices is also a .GeomVertexArrayData. Let's assume we want to render a square consisting of two triangles:",
