  "content": "This chunk pertains to specific configuration parameters in a software system, likely related to graphical or application settings. The variables discussed include window positioning, sizing, drawing behavior, inversion for debugging, title naming, rendering type, frame rate control, main loop management, error handling, and mouse wheel events. These configurations are crucial for setting up the visual environment and performance of an application, ensuring it runs smoothly and as intended.\n\nmeans to center the window on the screen. win-size int 800 600 (from Config.prc); 800 600 hardcoded This is the default size at which to open a new window. This\nreplaces the deprecated win-width and win-height variables. win-unexposed-draw bool 1 Specifies the default setting of\nGraphicsWindow::set_unexposed_draw(). See that method for more\ninformation. window-inverted bool 0 Set this true to create all windows with the inverted flag set, so\nthat they will render upside-down and backwards. Normally this is useful\nonly for debugging. window-title string Panda window-type string onscreen DConfig wx-frame-rate double 60.0 Set a timer to run the Panda frame 60 times per second. wx-main-loop bool 1 Put wxPython in charge of the main loop; some features of wx don't\nwork properly unless this is true. x-error-abort bool 0 Set this true to trigger and abort (and a stack trace) on receipt of\nan error from the X window system. This can make it easier to discover",
