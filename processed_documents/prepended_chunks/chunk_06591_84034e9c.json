  "content": "The chunk provides an overview and introduction to using the Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) with Panda3D, explaining its benefits for complex physics simulations beyond Panda3D's built-in capabilities. It outlines the structure of the section, including key topics like worlds, bodies, masses, simulation, joints, and collision detection, while also referencing available API documentation and additional resources.\n\nUsing ODE with Panda3D\n\nPanda3D also provides integration for the Open Dynamics Engine. This is a platform-independent open-source physics engine with advanced types and built-in collision detection. Panda3D provides support for ODE because sometimes Panda's limited built-in physics system might not always be enough to suit more complex needs.\n\nThis section will explain how to use this ODE system with Panda3D.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nworlds-bodies-masses simulating-physics-world attaching-bodies-using-joints collision-detection\n\nMore information\n\nThe panda3d.ode page in the API Reference can list the classes and methods available (all of the classes are prefixed with Ode), although the function descriptions are lacking. It might also be useful to look at the PyODE API reference, which uses very similar class and method names.",
