  "content": "This chunk provides essential information about how to retrieve the mouse position in Python and C++ within a Panda3D application, including examples of event handling for mouse clicks and wheel movements. It also touches on hiding the mouse cursor through configuration files or code, making it a fundamental resource for developers working with mouse input in their applications.\n\nTo get the position:\n\npython\n\nif base.mouseWatcherNode.hasMouse():\n  x = base.mouseWatcherNode.getMouseX()\n  y = base.mouseWatcherNode.getMouseY()\n\ncpp\n\nif (mouseWatcher->has_mouse()) {\n  if (window->get_graphics_window()) {\n    int x = window->get_graphics_window()->get_pointer(0).get_x();\n    int y = window->get_graphics_window()->get_pointer(0).get_y();\n  }\n}\n\nThe mouse clicks generate \"events.\" To understand what events are, and how to process them, you will need to read the Event Handling <tasks-and-event-handling> section. The names of the events generated are:\n\nmouse1 Mouse Button 1 Pressed mouse2 Mouse Button 2 Pressed mouse3 Mouse Button 3 Pressed mouse1-up Mouse Button 1 Released mouse2-up Mouse Button 2 Released mouse3-up Mouse Button 3 Released wheel_up Mouse Wheel rolled upwards wheel_down Mouse Wheel rolled downwards\n\nIf you want to hide the mouse cursor, you want the line: cursor-hidden true in your Config.prc <configuring-panda3d> or this section of code:\n\npython",
