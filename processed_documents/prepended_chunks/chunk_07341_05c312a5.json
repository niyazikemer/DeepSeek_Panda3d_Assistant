  "content": "The Conclusion summarizes the document's exploration of subclassing C++ classes from Python, emphasizing the limitations and practical workarounds using Python tags, while highlighting performance considerations for real-world applications.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion we might not be able to truly subclass a C++ class from Python, but we can certainly get very close to it. There is of course an overhead and these solutions should not be overused, resorting to pure C++ subclasses where performance is an issue. But where performance is not -as much- of an issue, you can probably get a lot of mileage following the examples provided above and expanding upon them.",
