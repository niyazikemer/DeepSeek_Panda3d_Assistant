  "content": "The code chunk is part of a generator function within the `GarbageReport` class that processes garbage objects to detect cycles. The specific lines are used to extend a list of garbage objects so that iteration can safely proceed beyond the original length without causing index errors during cycle detection.\n\nContext: This code is from the `getNumCycles` method in the `GarbageReport` class, which identifies and reports garbage cycles to help debug memory leaks in Python applications. The code chunk ensures safe iteration over garbage object references for cycle detection.\n\nyield None\n                    # make the list repeat so we can safely iterate off the end\n                    numObjs = len(objs) - 1\n                    objs.extend(objs)",
