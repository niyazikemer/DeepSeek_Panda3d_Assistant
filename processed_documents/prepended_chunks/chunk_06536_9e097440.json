Panda3D uses the OpenAL Soft implementation.\n\nFMOD is a powerful proprietary cross-platform sound engine that supports various types of sound files - MP3, WAV, AIFF, MIDI, MOD, WMA, and OGG Vorbis. However, its license restricts you from using it for commercial purposes unless you actually purchase a special license. Non-commercial use of FMOD is free of charge. (For more information on this, visit the FMOD Licenses page.)\n\nMiles is a sound system that is not included in the downloadable binaries of Panda3D. In order to use this you will need to purchase Miles and compile Panda3D from scratch using the ppremake system\n\nIf these choices are not enough for you, then you can try other sound libraries.\n\nSetting the Sound System",
