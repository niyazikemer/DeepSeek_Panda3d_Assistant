  "content": "This chunk appears within a Python class designed for tracking object references, likely used for debugging or memory management purposes. The `goesThrough` method checks if a specific object (identified by its ID) is part of the reference graph being tracked by the class instance. This method allows users to verify whether an object is involved in the chain of references that the tracker monitors, aiding in debugging potential issues like unintended references or memory leaks.\n\nyield id(o) == objId\n\n    def goesThrough(self, obj=None, objId=None):\n        # since we cache the ids involved in this reference,\n        # this isn't perfect, for example if base.myObject is reassigned\n        # to a different object after this Ref was created this would return\n        # false, allowing a ref to base.myObject.otherObject.myObject\n        for goesThrough in self.goesThroughGen(obj=obj, objId=objId):\n            pass\n        return goesThrough",
