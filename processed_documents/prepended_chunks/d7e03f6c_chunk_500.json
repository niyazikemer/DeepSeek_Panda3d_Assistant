  "content": "The code chunk is situated within the `addNewObject` method of the `ObjectGraph` class, which handles the creation and setup of new objects in a 3D scene graph. The specific portion manages the creation of non-actor objects (e.g., static models) by attaching them to a hidden node, loading their animations, setting default animations, reparenting them to the specified parent node, and marking them with an 'OBJRoot' tag for identification within the scene hierarchy.\n\n**Context:**\nThe code is part of a system that dynamically adds new 3D objects (actors or nodes) to a scene. The chunk handles the creation and setup of non-actor objects by attaching them as hidden nodes, loading animations, ensuring default animation playback, reparenting the object, and tagging it for scene management.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe code chunk is part of the `addNewObject` method in the `ObjectGraph` class, which creates new 3D objects (actors or nodes) within a scene.
