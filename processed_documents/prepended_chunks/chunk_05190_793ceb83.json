  "content": "The chunk manages how a server handles a client's update about an object moving to a new zone. It includes methods to process the message (handleClientObjectSetZone) and adjust the object's location (setObjectZone), updating tracking structures for accurate distribution of information to interested clients.\n\nContext: Handling Object Zone Changes in ServerRepository\n\nThe provided code chunk is part of the ServerRepository class, focusing on managing objects when they change zones. The `handleClientObjectSetZone` method processes a client's message about an object moving between zones. It retrieves the object based on its doId and calls `setObjectZone` to update its zone. The `setObjectZone` method checks if the new zone differs from the current one; if so, it updates internal structures to track the object's location and ensures other interested clients receive necessary updates. This chunk is crucial for maintaining accurate object tracking and enabling proper communication between clients regarding zone changes.\n\nself.updateClientInterestZones(client)\n\n    def handleClientObjectSetZone(self, datagram, dgi):\n        \"\"\" The client is telling us the object is changing to a new\n        zone. \"\"\"\n        doId = dgi.getUint32()\n        zoneId = dgi.getUint32()\n\n        connection = datagram.getConnection()\n        client = self.clientsByConnection[connection]\n        object = client.objectsByDoId.get(doId)\n        if not object:\n            # Don't know this object.\n            self.notify.warning(\"Ignoring object location for %s: unknown\" % (doId))\n            return\n\n        self.setObjectZone(client, object, zoneId)\n\n    def setObjectZone(self, owner, object, zoneId):\n        if object.zoneId == zoneId:\n            # No change.\n            return",
