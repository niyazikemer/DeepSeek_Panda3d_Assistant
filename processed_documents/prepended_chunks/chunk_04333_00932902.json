  "content": "The code chunk discusses handling extension module imports from virtual files in Python, focusing on determining if a file exists as a real file or needs temporary storage for import. This fits within the VFSImporter class, specifically where it checks if a file is importable, ensuring proper handling of different file types during the import process.\n\n**Context:**\n\nThis chunk is situated within the `VFSImporter` class, likely in the `_isImportable` method. It determines whether an extension module can be imported directly or needs to be temporarily written to disk when dealing with virtual files that don't correspond to a real file on the system.\n\n# We can only import an extension module if it already exists on\n        # disk.  This means if it's a truly virtual file that has no\n        # on-disk equivalent, we have to write it to a temporary file\n        # first.\n        if hasattr(vfile, 'getMount') and \\\n           isinstance(vfile.getMount(), VirtualFileMountSystem):\n            # It's a real file.\n            filename = self.filename\n        elif self.filename.exists():\n            # It's a virtual file, but it's shadowing a real file in\n            # the same directory.  Assume they're the same, and load\n            # the real one.\n            filename = self.filename\n        else:\n            # It's a virtual file with no real-world existence.  Dump\n            # it to disk.  TODO: clean up this filename.\n            filename = Filename.temporary('', self.filename.getBasenameWoExtension(),\n                                          '.' + self.filename.getExtension(),",
