The code scales the aspect2d node to maintain proper proportions based on the window's aspect ratio and establishes boundaries for top, bottom, left, and right borders of the 2D rendering area. This is crucial for ensuring that UI elements and other 2D graphics are displayed correctly relative to the screen dimensions.\n\naspectRatio = self.getAspectRatio()\n        self.aspect2d.setScale(1.0 / aspectRatio, 1.0, 1.0)\n\n        self.a2dBackground = self.aspect2d.attachNewNode(\"a2dBackground\")\n\n        #: The Z position of the top border of the aspect2d screen.\n        self.a2dTop = 1.0\n        #: The Z position of the bottom border of the aspect2d screen.\n        self.a2dBottom = -1.0\n        #: The X position of the left border of the aspect2d screen.\n        self.a2dLeft = -aspectRatio\n        #: The X position of the right border of the aspect2d screen.\n        self.a2dRight = aspectRatio",
