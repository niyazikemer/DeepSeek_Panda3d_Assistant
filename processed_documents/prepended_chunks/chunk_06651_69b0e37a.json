  "content": "The given chunk is part of an implementation example for a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Panda3D, specifically illustrating how state transitions are handled through filter functions. The `filterEast` method processes input requests to determine the next state, demonstrating how 'straight' maintains the current state while 'left' transitions to North. This section follows the introduction of similar methods for other states and precedes a discussion on using a default filter method for general case handling.\n\nContext:\nThe code chunk is situated within an example implementation that demonstrates how each state in a compass-direction FSM processes input requests ('straight' or 'left') to transition between states. The `filterEast` function specifically handles transitions from the East state, returning 'East' for 'straight' and 'North' for 'left'. This follows similar implementations for North, West, and South states. The chunk is preceded by an explanation of input conventions (lowercase for requests vs. uppercase for states) and includes example `request()` calls to illustrate FSM interaction. It concludes with a note on the resulting state after a series of inputs, providing context for understanding state transitions within the FSM framework.\n\ndef filterEast(self, request, args):\n        if request == 'straight':\n            return 'East'\n        elif request == 'left':\n            return 'North'\n        else:\n            return None\n\nNote that input strings, by convention, should begin with a lowercase letter, as opposed to state names, which should begin with an uppercase letter. This allows you to make the distinction between requesting a state directly, and feeding a particular input string to an FSM. To feed input to this FSM, you would use the request() call, just as before:\n\nmyfsm.request('left') # or myfsm.request_left()\nmyfsm.request('left')\nmyfsm.request('straight') # or myfsm.request_straight()\nmyfsm.request('left')\n\nIf the FSM had been in state North originally, after the above sequence of operations it would now be in state East.\n\nThe defaultFilter method",
