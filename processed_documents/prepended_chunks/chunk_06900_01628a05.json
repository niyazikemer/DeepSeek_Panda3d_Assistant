  "content": "The document discusses how Panda3D's automatic shader generation works, including enabling it, combining it with manual shaders, caching optimizations, and then provides information on extending this functionality by creating a custom shader generator.\n\nCreating your own Shader Generator\n\nWe anticipate that people who are writing full-fledged commercial games using Panda3D might want to write their own shader generators. In this way, you can get any effect you imagine without having to give up the convenience and elegance of being able to simply apply a normal map or a gloss map to a model, and having it \"just work.\"\n\nTo create your own shader generator, you will need to delve into Panda3D's C++ code. Class ShaderGenerator is meant to be subclassed, and a hook function is provided to enable you to turn on your own generator.",
