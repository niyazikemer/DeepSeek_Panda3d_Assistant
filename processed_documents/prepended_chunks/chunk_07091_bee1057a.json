  "content": "This chunk provides specific examples of performance issues caused by bugs in game development, such as forgotten object removal and unnecessary collision checks, illustrating how seemingly minor oversights can lead to significant performance problems that require debugging rather than redesign.\n\nA shooter allowed you to fire bullets from your gun. But they forgot to remove the bullet after it collided with a wall. As a result, the bullets just kept going through the wall, and into outer space. Every bullet you or anyone else had ever fired was still flying through space, and the animation system was working like crazy to animate tens of thousands of bullets.\n\nA team had gone through the effort of creating optimized collision geometry for their scenes, but they accidentally forgot to disable the collision check against the unoptimized visible geometry. Now, Panda3D was spending a lot of time checking collisions against both the optimized and the highly detailed, unoptimized collision geometry.",
