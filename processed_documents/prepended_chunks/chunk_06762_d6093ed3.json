  "content": "The provided chunk is part of a comprehensive document detailing system settings and configurations for software development, specifically relating to multimedia handling with ffmpeg. The chunk focuses on ffmpeg-specific options such as thread safety, performance tuning, and seeking behavior within the application's configuration framework.\n\nis not compiled for a release build. ffmpeg-global-lock bool 0 Set this true to enable a single global mutex across *all* ffmpeg\noperations. Leave this false to use the mutex only for the ffmpeg\noperations that are generally known to be not thread-safe. This will\nnegatively affect ffmpeg performance, especially when decoding multiple\nvideos at once (including the left and right channels of a stereo\nvideo). Set this true only if you suspect a problem with ffmpeg's own\nthread-safe nature. ffmpeg-max-readahead-frames int 2 The maximum number of frames ahead which an ffmpeg decoder thread\nshould read in advance of actual playback. Set this to 0 to decode\nffmpeg videos in the main thread. ffmpeg-read-buffer-size int 4096 The size in bytes of the buffer used when reading input files. This\nis important for performance. A typical size is that of a cache page,\ne.g. 4kb. ffmpeg-show-seek-frames bool 1 Set this true to allow showing the intermediate results of seeking",
