  "content": "The chunk is part of a section discussing changes in the Max exporter for Panda3D, specifically regarding how to tag objects as collision solids and set their flags using User Defined properties in 3ds Max.\n\nEvery collision object in Panda has a Collision Solid Type and a Collision Flag. To tag an object you have to type the \"<solid type> = 1\". Where <solid type> is polyset, plane, etc. Next you must specify a collision flag in the same manner (ex. descend = 1). Be sure to note the all lowercase and spaces between the equals sign and the 1. To remove any tag simply set the value of one to zero on both properties. in order to speed up this process we've included a simple Maxscript utility called TagSelectedObjects.ms. Simply run this either from the main program menu bar, or anywhere else in the program where you can run a Maxscript. It will allow you to select any number of objects and tag them or remove any tags on the objects.",
