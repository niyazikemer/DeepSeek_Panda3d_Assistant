  "content": "The code chunk is part of an `OnscreenText` class implementation in a Python module, likely used for rendering text in a 3D graphics application (e.g., Panda3D). The chunk includes methods for node management (`cleanup`, `destroy`), resource handling (`freeze`, `thaw`), and dynamic configuration of properties like decal effects. These functions enable lifecycle control and graphical property adjustments after object creation, facilitating interactive placement and post-initialization modifications.\n\nself.isClean = 0\n\n        # Set ourselves up as the NodePath that points to this node.\n        self.assign(parent.attachNewNode(self.textNode, sort))\n\n    def cleanup(self):\n        self.textNode = None\n        if self.isClean == 0:\n            self.isClean = 1\n            self.removeNode()\n\n    def destroy(self):\n        self.cleanup()\n\n    def freeze(self):\n        pass\n\n    def thaw(self):\n        pass\n\n    # Allow changing of several of the parameters after the text has\n    # been created.
