  "content": "The chunk is part of an explanation about the limitations of linear fog effects in computer graphics, specifically addressing a hardware-related issue where the fog effect can break down depending on the viewing angle relative to the camera. This context is situated within a discussion of linear fog's technical challenges and its dependence on camera orientation for accurate rendering.\n\nThere is a hardware issue with rendering fog which means that linear fog can break down and vanish depending on the angle from which it is viewed:\n\n\"the underlying fog effect supported by hardware is generally only one-dimensional, and must be rendered based on linear distance from the camera plane. Thus, this in-the-world effect is most effective when the fog vector from onset point to opaque point is most nearly parallel to the camera\u2019s eye vector. As the angle between the fog vector and the eye vector increases, the accuracy of the effect diminishes, up to a complete breakdown of the effect at a 90 degree angle.\"",
