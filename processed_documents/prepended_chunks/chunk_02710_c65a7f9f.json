  "content": "The provided chunk is part of a Python class's documentation string (docstring), specifically explaining the structure and usage of state names within a finite state machine model. The docstring details how each entry in a list corresponds to specific states, represented by numbers 0 through 4, and provides a diagram illustrating the state transitions and relationships. This context is crucial for understanding how the class initializes and manages its state configurations.\n\nContext: The chunk is located within the class's docstring, detailing the structure of state name mappings and their corresponding visual representation in the form of a state transition diagram.\n\nEach list must have five entries.\n\n        .. rubric:: More Details\n\n        Here is a diagram showing the where the names from the list\n        are used::\n\n            +---------+\n            | 0 (off) |----> (any other state and vice versa).\n            +---------+\n\n                       +--------+\n                    -->| 4 (on) |---\n                   |   +--------+   |\n                   |                |\n                   |                v\n             +---------+       +---------+\n             | 3 (off) |<----->| 1 (off) |\n             +---------+       +---------+\n                   ^                |\n                   |                |\n                   |  +---------+   |\n                    --| 2 (off) |<--\n                      +---------+",
