  "content": "This chunk is part of a section discussing how materials from 3ds Max are mapped to Panda3D's egg format. It explains the correspondence between various material slots in 3ds Max (such as Diffuse, Bump, Self-Illumination) and their equivalents in Panda3D. Additionally, it introduces changes and additions in the Panda3D Max egger tool, particularly regarding collision object tagging using User Defined properties in 3ds Max.\n\nDiffuse Slot = Color\n\nBump Slot = Normal\n\nSelf-Illumination Slot = Glow\n\nSpecular Color Slot = Gloss\n\nOpacity Slot = Modulate\n\nMax egger changes and additions\n\nIn Panda3D 1.7.0, there have been some minor but very noticeable changes to the way the Max egger handles collisions. Although collision tagging was possible on a global level with the egger prior to now, it had some drawbacks, such as only one object would get tagged if the whole scene was exported. To remedy this problem, the Panda SE team has implemented a method similar to the way Maya tags collision objects. Every object in max has a User Defined properties box inside the per- object properties options. (to get it simply right click on any object and select Object Properties, User Defined is the far right tab).",
