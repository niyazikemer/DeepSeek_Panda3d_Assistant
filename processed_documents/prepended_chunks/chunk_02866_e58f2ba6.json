This method handles the finalization of an animation interval, ensuring that the animation ends correctly by posing all controls to the appropriate frame based on the duration and loop settings. The chunk specifically addresses cases where the user has explicitly defined a duration, determining the final frame accordingly.\n\n```context\nThis code snippet is part of the `privFinalize` method in the `AnimControlInterval` class, which manages the termination phase of an animation interval.
