  "content": "The given code chunk contains two methods: `rotateAboutViewVector` and `scale1D`. These methods are part of a class (likely `DirectManipulate`) that handles interactive manipulation of 3D objects. The `rotateAboutViewVector` function manages rotation based on mouse movement relative to the view vector, while `scale1D` handles scaling with constraints. Together, they contribute to a system enabling users to move, rotate, and scale objects interactively in a 3D environment.\n\ndef rotateAboutViewVector(self, state):\n        # Reset init flag in case we switch to another mode\n        self.fHitInit = 1\n        # Reset scaling init flag\n        self.fScaleInit = 1\n        # Compute current angle\n        angle = getCrankAngle(state.coaCenter)\n        deltaAngle = angle - state.lastAngle\n        state.lastAngle = angle\n        # Mouse motion edge to edge of display region results in one full turn\n        relHpr(ShowBaseGlobal.direct.widget, ShowBaseGlobal.direct.camera, 0, 0, -deltaAngle)\n\n    def scale1D(self, state):\n        assert self.constraint is not None",
