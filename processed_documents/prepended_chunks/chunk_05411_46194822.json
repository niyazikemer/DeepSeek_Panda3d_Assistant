  "content": "This code chunk defines a set of client-related message types within the `MsgTypes` module, which is part of a larger system for managing distributed object communication. These messages include basic client-server interactions like hello and disconnect notifications, heartbeat maintenance, object field updates, and interest management responses. The chunk sits within a broader document that maps these message names to unique IDs and provides utilities for converting between names and IDs, as well as handling client agent control operations and quiet zone ignored lists.\n\n\"\"\"MsgTypes module: contains distributed object message types\"\"\"\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nfrom direct.showbase.PythonUtil import invertDictLossless\n\nCLIENT_HELLO =                                 1\nCLIENT_HELLO_RESP =                            2\n\n# Sent by the client when it's leaving.\nCLIENT_DISCONNECT =                            3\n\n# Sent by the server when it is dropping the connection deliberately.\nCLIENT_EJECT =                                 4\n\nCLIENT_HEARTBEAT =                             5\n\nCLIENT_OBJECT_SET_FIELD =                      120\nCLIENT_OBJECT_SET_FIELDS =                     121\nCLIENT_OBJECT_LEAVING =                        132\nCLIENT_OBJECT_LEAVING_OWNER =                  161\nCLIENT_ENTER_OBJECT_REQUIRED =                 142\nCLIENT_ENTER_OBJECT_REQUIRED_OTHER =           143\nCLIENT_ENTER_OBJECT_REQUIRED_OWNER =           172\nCLIENT_ENTER_OBJECT_REQUIRED_OTHER_OWNER =     173\n\nCLIENT_DONE_INTEREST_RESP =                    204",
