  "content": "The chunk explains how to configure the threading model for the Multithreaded Render Pipeline in Panda3D, providing examples and clarifying thread naming conventions for Cull and Draw phases.\n\nMore generally, the threading model defines the names of the two threads that serve Cull and Draw. A slash separates the two phases. If the thread name for either phase is the empty string, then the name is understood to be the same name as the previous phase (or the App phase for the first one). If two threads have the same name, they refer to the same thread, so \"Cull/Cull\" means to place both Cull and Draw on the same thread, named \"Cull\". The specific name is irrelevant; it could have been called \"Foo/Foo\" just as easily.",
