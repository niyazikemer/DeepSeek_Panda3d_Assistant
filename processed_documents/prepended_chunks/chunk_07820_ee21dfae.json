  "content": "This chunk provides an overview of the `OnscreenText` class, which offers a simplified approach to rendering text on screen in Panda3D. It is particularly useful for quick implementations where basic text display is required without the need for advanced TextNode properties or DirectGUI features. This section complements the broader discussion of rendering options and customization available with TextNodes, providing developers with an alternative tool for straightforward text presentation.\n\nRendering Text\n\npython\n\nOnscreenText\n\n~.direct.gui.OnscreenText.OnscreenText is a convenience class that is used a quick way to put text onscreen without having to go through the trouble of creating a TextNode and setting properties on it. However, it doesn't have the full range of rendering options that you can get with TextNode directly; and it doesn't support the DirectGUI features of a directlabel. Use an OnscreenText whenever you want a quick way to display some ordinary text without a lot of fancy requirements.\n\nfrom direct.gui.OnscreenText import OnscreenText\ntextObject = OnscreenText(text='my text string', pos=(-0.5, 0.02), scale=0.07)\n\nThe OnscreenText object inherits from NodePath, so all of the standard NodePath operations can be used on the text object. When you are ready to take the text away, use:\n\ntextObject.destroy()\n\nA full list of arguments that can be passed to the constructor is available on the ~.direct.gui.OnscreenText.OnscreenText page of the API reference.",
