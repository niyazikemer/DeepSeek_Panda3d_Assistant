  "content": "The provided chunk from the document serves as an introduction to the Egg file format within Panda3D. It explains the nature of Egg files as a text-based format, their ability to handle static geometry and animations, and their comparison with Bam. The section also covers supported features like vertices and joints, limitations such as the absence of light sources, and how to create these files using modeling software with specific tools.\n\nContext: This chunk introduces the Egg file format in Panda3D, detailing its capabilities, limitations, and creation process.\n\nEgg Files\n\nThe Egg format is a file format unique to Panda3D. It is a text-based format, which means it can be opened in a text editor to inspect its contents.\n\nAn Egg file can contain static geometry, but it can also contain information for animating the model, as well as information about the model's material, ie. what color the material has, and how this color changes under the influence of lighting). However, unlike Bam, it cannot represent all of the things that are possible in Panda3D. For instance, light sources are not represented.\n\nTo create an Egg file, you will need to use a modeling program (like Autodesk Maya or 3ds Max) combined with either an export plugin or a file format converter. You can read more about this process in the following sections.\n\nThe Egg format supports, among other things:\n\nVertices\n\nTriangles and larger polygons\n\nJoints (aka Bones)\n\nVertex weights\n\nTexture pathnames (textures are not stored)\n\nBone-based animation keyframes",
