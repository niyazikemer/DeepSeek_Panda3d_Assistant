  "content": "The chunk explains the use of \"uniform\" and \"in\" keywords in a Cg vertex shader within the context of a tutorial on shaders in Panda3D. It describes how the \"in\" keyword is used to receive input (vtx_position) from the egg file, which represents the vertex coordinates, and references the List of Possible Shader Inputs for further details.\n\nIf we take a closer look at the vertex shader, we can see a new line with the keyword \"uniform\" and a line with the \"in\" keyword. The \"in\" keyword means that there is some input from somewhere, in this case the input is named vtx_position. Referencing the List of Possible Shader Inputs <list-of-possible-cg-shader-inputs>, you can see that vtx_position is a reserved name. The input vtx_position gives us is the vertex coordinates for the vertex as it appears in the egg file.",
