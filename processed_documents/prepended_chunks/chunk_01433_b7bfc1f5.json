The chunk includes the class docstring, imports, and initial setup, which are typically placed at the top of the file to provide context and documentation for users and search engines.\n\nContext:  \nThe chunk introduces the `DirectRadioButton` class with its purpose, functionality, and relationship to other classes like `DirectCheckButton`. It also contains essential imports and references needed for the implementation. This introduction is critical for understanding the module's purpose and improving code searchability.\n\n\"\"\"A DirectRadioButton is a type of button that, similar to a\nDirectCheckButton, has a separate indicator and can be toggled between\ntwo states.  However, only one DirectRadioButton in a group can be enabled\nat a particular time.\n\nSee the :ref:`directradiobutton` page in the programming manual for a more\nin-depth explanation and an example of how to use this class.\n\"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ['DirectRadioButton']\n\nfrom panda3d.core import PGFrameStyle, VBase4\nfrom . import DirectGuiGlobals as DGG\nfrom .DirectButton import DirectButton\nfrom .DirectLabel import DirectLabel",
