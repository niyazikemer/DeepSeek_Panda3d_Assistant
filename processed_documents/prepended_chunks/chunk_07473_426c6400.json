  "content": "The context situates a detailed explanation of PStats operation, focusing on how data flows from clients to servers, processing, and visualization. The chunk describes running pstats.exe, connecting clients, and creating monitor windows with graphs like frame time strip charts, following an overview of the system's architecture.\n\nWhen you run pstats.exe, it adds a program to the taskbar but does not immediately open a window. The program name is typically \"PStats 5185\", showing the default PStats TCP port number of 5185; see \"HOW IT WORKS\" below for more details about the TCP communication system. For the most part you don't need to worry about the port number, as long as server and client agree (and the port is not already being used by another application).\n\nEach time a client connects to the PStats server, a new monitor window is created. This monitor window owns all of the graphs that you create to view the performance data from that particular connection. Initially, a strip chart showing the frame time of the main thread is created by default; you can create additional graphs by selecting from the Graphs pulldown menu.\n\nTime-based Strip Charts",
