  "content": "The chunk discusses CollisionHandlerPusher, a sophisticated collision handler in Panda3D that prevents objects from entering walls by pushing them back, while also inheriting event capabilities for custom responses.\n\nNote that all of the following versions of CollisionHandler also inherit from CollisionHandlerEvent, so any of them can be set up to throw events in the same way.\n\nCollisionHandlerPusher\n\nThis is the first of the more sophisticated handlers. The CollisionHandlerPusher, in addition to inheriting all of the event logic from CollisionHandlerEvent, will automatically push back on its from object to keep it out of walls. The visual effect is that your object will simply stop moving when it reaches a wall if it hits the wall head-on, or it will slide along the wall smoothly if it strikes the wall at an angle.",
