  "content": "This chunk introduces the concept of Portal Culling as a method for managing visibility in 3D scenes by dividing spaces into cells connected through portals, explaining its application and limitations in environments like buildings or caves versus open areas.\n\nPortal Culling\n\nWhat is Portal Culling?\n\nPortal culling is a method by which the 3D scene can be broken into areas called cells, which are linked together by portals. A portal is a window in 3D space that allows objects in one cell (the \"out\" cell) to be seen from another cell (the \"in\" cell). Portal culling works best in scenes where there is limited visibility from one area to another, for example a building or network of caves. It has very limited use in wide open scenes.",
