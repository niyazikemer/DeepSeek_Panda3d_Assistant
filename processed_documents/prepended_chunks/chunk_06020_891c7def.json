  "content": "The chunk provides specific instructions for Maya/Max users on converting egg files and guidance for Blender users on creating meshes, including scale recommendations and tool downloads.\n\nC:\\Panda3D-|release|-x64\\bin\\egg-trans -C -o out.egg in.egg\n\nThe egg file that is thereby generated should be passed to the Mesh Generation Tool.\n\nBlender Users (IMPORTANT)\n\nCreation of the full and collision meshes is to be done on the x-y plane. This makes it much easier to just get in to Blender and create a mesh since the starting view is a top view of the x-y plane.\n\nNOTE : We advice to make meshes with a scale of 50 or above for best results. It would be wise to make your world based on this scale. Much smaller meshes bug out a bit.\n\nNOTE : To make faces on your plane mesh, use the subdivide utility in Blender in Edit Mode and to delete faces option when you enter Face Selection Mode while you are in Edit Mode.\n\nPLEASE NOTE : Download the mesh generators from here :\n\nMaya and Max :\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/etcpandai/download/meshgen_v1.0_exec.zip?attredirects=0&d=1\n\nBlender : (source also available in the Open Source section)",
