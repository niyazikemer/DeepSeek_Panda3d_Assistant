  "content": "This code chunk appears in the `add_vertex` method of a motion trail system implementation. It adds a new vertex to the motion trail with specified properties such as a vertex ID, optional vertex function, start and end colors, and context information. This allows for customizing the appearance and behavior of individual points along the motion trail. After adding a vertex, users must call `update_vertices()` to apply changes before rendering.\n\nAfter calling this, you must call `update_vertices()` before the\n        changes will fully take effect.\n\n        As of Panda3D 1.10.13, you may alternatively simply pass in a single\n        argument containing the vertex position as a `.Vec4` or `.Point3`.\n        \"\"\"\n        if vertex_function is None:\n            motion_trail_vertex = MotionTrailVertex(None, None, context)\n            motion_trail_vertex.vertex = Vec4(vertex_id)\n        else:\n            motion_trail_vertex = MotionTrailVertex(vertex_id, vertex_function, context)\n        motion_trail_vertex.start_color = Vec4(start_color)\n        motion_trail_vertex.end_color = Vec4(end_color)\n        total_vertices = len(self.vertex_list)\n\n        self.vertex_list[total_vertices : total_vertices] = [motion_trail_vertex]\n\n        self.total_vertices = len(self.vertex_list)\n\n        self.modified_vertices = True\n\n        return motion_trail_vertex",
