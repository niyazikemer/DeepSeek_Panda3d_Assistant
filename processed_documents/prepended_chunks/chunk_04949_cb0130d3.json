  "content": "The provided chunk is part of a Python class (likely `ShowBase` or similar) that manages audio systems. It defines two methods: `addSfxManager`, which adds an additional sound effects (SFX) manager to a list and sets its activity, and `createBaseAudioManagers`, which initializes default SFX and music managers for the application. These methods are used to handle audio playback and management within a game or 3D rendering framework.\n\ndef addSfxManager(self, extraSfxManager):\n        \"\"\"\n        Adds an additional SFX audio manager to `sfxManagerList`, the list of\n        managers managed by ShowBase.\n        \"\"\"\n        # keep a list of sfx manager objects to apply settings to,\n        # since there may be others in addition to the one we create here\n        self.sfxManagerList.append(extraSfxManager)\n        newSfxManagerIsValid = extraSfxManager is not None and extraSfxManager.isValid()\n        self.sfxManagerIsValidList.append(newSfxManagerIsValid)\n        if newSfxManagerIsValid:\n            extraSfxManager.setActive(self.sfxActive)\n\n    def createBaseAudioManagers(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Creates the default SFX and music manager.
