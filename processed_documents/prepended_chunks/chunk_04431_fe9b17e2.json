  "content": "The `__asyncFlattenDone` method is a utility function within a class responsible for asynchronously processing 3D model flattening operations. The method is invoked after an asynchronous flatten request completes, ensuring that the newly flattened model nodes replace the original models in memory while preserving their properties and maintaining scene integrity. This functionality is part of a larger framework for managing 3D assets, including loading, unloading, and manipulating geometric data efficiently.\n\ndef __asyncFlattenDone(self, models,\n                           gotList, callback, origModelList, extraArgs):\n        \"\"\" The asynchronous flatten operation has completed; quietly\n        drop in the new models. \"\"\"\n        self.notify.debug(\"asyncFlattenDone: %s\" % (models,))\n        assert len(models) == len(origModelList)\n        for i, model in enumerate(models):\n            origModelList[i].getChildren().detach()\n            orig = origModelList[i].node()\n            flat = model.node()\n            orig.copyAllProperties(flat)\n            flat.replaceNode(orig)\n\n        if callback:\n            if gotList:\n                callback(origModelList, *extraArgs)\n            else:\n                callback(*(origModelList + extraArgs))",
