  "content": "The given text discusses particle effect configuration in Panda3D, covering system setup options like particle count and lifespan, renderer settings for visual appearance, and force parameters for realistic movement.\n\nVariation in particle mass.\n\nAverage particle terminal velocity.\n\nVariation in terminal velocity.\n\nSome of this information can also be found in the Particle Factories page.\n\nEmitter:\n\nThere are a large number of particle emitters, each categorized by the volume of space they represent.\n\nAll emitters have three modes: explicit, radiate, and custom. Explicit mode emits the particles in parallel in the same direction. Radiate mode emits particles away from a specific point. Custom mode emits particles with a velocity determined by the particular emitter.\n\nLaunch velocity multiplier (all emission modes)\n\nSpread for launch velocity multiplier (all emission modes)\n\nVelocity vector applied to all particles.\n\nAll particles launch with this velocity in Explicit mode.\n\nParticles launch away from this point in Radiate mode.\n\nSome of this information can also be found in the Particle Emitters page.\n\nRenderer:",
