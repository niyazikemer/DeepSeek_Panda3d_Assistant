  "content": "This chunk is part of a comprehensive guide detailing how to play and manage MPG and AVI files in Panda. It provides an introduction to using these file formats as textures, explains essential functions for controlling movie playback, discusses handling audio separately, and addresses limitations related to graphics hardware.\n\nPlaying MPG and AVI files\n\nPanda now supports AVI format for textures in Panda.\n\nUsage\n\nmyMovieTexture = loader.loadTexture(\"myMovie.avi\")\nmyObject.setTexture(myMovieTexture)\n\nThe movie subsystem is implemented using FFMPEG. Therefore, it supports all of the formats that FFMPEG supports. The functions to control the movie are as follows:\n\nmovie.play()\nmovie.stop()\nmovie.setTime(t)\nmovie.getTime()\nmovie.setLoopCount(n)\nmovie.getLoopCount()\nmovie.setPlayRate(speed)\nmovie.getPlayRate()\nmovie.isPlaying()\n\nIf you want to hear the movie's audio as well, you need to load it twice: once as a texture, and once as a sound file:\n\nmySound = loader.loadSfx(\"myMovie.avi\")\n\nThen, you can synchronize the video to the audio:\n\nmyMovieTexture.synchronizeTo(mySound)\n\nFrom that point forward, playing the audio will cause the texture to update. This is more accurate than synchronizing the video manually.\n\nFor powers-of-two limited graphics hardware",
