  "content": "The provided code chunk introduces a `StackTrace` class within a debugging context. It captures and stores the current stack trace along with a label, starting from a specified frame and limiting the number of frames recorded, enhancing error tracking in debug mode.\n\n**Context:**  \nThis code is part of a Python utility module that includes various helper functions and classes for managing program execution and debugging. The `StackTrace` class, defined within an `if __debug__:` block, allows developers to capture detailed stack trace information, which is particularly useful for diagnosing issues during development.\n\nif __debug__:\n    import traceback\n    import marshal\n\n    class StackTrace:\n        def __init__(self, label=\"\", start=0, limit=None):\n            \"\"\"\n            label is a string (or anything that be be a string)\n            that is printed as part of the trace back.\n            This is just to make it easier to tell what the\n            stack trace is referring to.\n            start is an integer number of stack frames back\n            from the most recent.  (This is automatically\n            bumped up by one to skip the __init__ call\n            to the StackTrace).\n            limit is an integer number of stack frames\n            to record (or None for unlimited).\n            \"\"\"\n            self.label = label\n            if limit is not None:\n                self.trace = traceback.extract_stack(sys._getframe(1+start),\n                                                     limit=limit)\n            else:\n                self.trace = traceback.extract_stack(sys._getframe(1+start))",
