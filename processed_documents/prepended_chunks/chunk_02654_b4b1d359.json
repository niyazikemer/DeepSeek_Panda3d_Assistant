  "content": "The chunk provides an overview of a programming package that implements Finite State Machines (FSMs), highlighting their abstract nature, state transitions, and utility in logic programming tasks, while directing users to additional documentation for deeper understanding.\n\n\"\"\"\nThis package contains implementations of a Finite State Machine, an\nabstract construct that holds a particular state and can transition\nbetween several defined states.  These are useful for a range of logic\nprogramming tasks.\n\nFor more information on FSMs, consult the :ref:`finite-state-machines` section\nof the programming manual.\n\"\"\"",
