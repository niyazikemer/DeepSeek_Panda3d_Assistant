  "content": "This chunk introduces the fundamental concepts of lighting and materials in Panda3D. It explains how light is categorized into nondirectional and directional types and describes the different kinds of lights available. This section provides essential context for understanding how materials interact with light, serving as an introduction to the detailed discussion on material properties and their effects.\n\nContext: Introduces lighting basics and categories, crucial for comprehending how materials reflect light in Panda3D.\n\nThe tools provided are lights and materials. Lights are used to express how much light is striking the model. Materials are used to express how much of the light striking the model is reflected.\n\nPanda3D separates the light striking the model into two general categories: nondirectional, and directional. Directional light is light that comes straight from a particular lamp. Because we know where it's coming from, we also know what direction it is coming from. Nondirectional light is light that maybe came from somewhere, bounced around a bit, and then eventually hit the model. Because we don't know exactly where it came from, we don't know what direction it is coming from. Panda3D handles nondirectional and directional light separately.\n\nThere are four kinds of lights in Panda3D: ambient, point, diffuse, and directional. The ambient light only creates nondirectional light. The other three create directional light.",
