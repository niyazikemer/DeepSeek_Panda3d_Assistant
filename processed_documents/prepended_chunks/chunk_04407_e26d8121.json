  "content": "This chunk appears to be part of a `loadTexture` method implementation in a Python class designed for loading and managing various types of assets such as models, fonts, textures, sounds, etc. The code handles multiview/stereo texture loading by modifying the texture flags in the loader options based on a boolean parameter `multiview`. This functionality would allow developers to load left/right view images by replacing a '#' in the filename with '0' or '1'.\n\nIf multiview is true, it indicates to load a multiview or\n        stereo texture.  In this case, the filename should contain a\n        hash character ('#') that will be replaced with '0' for the\n        left image and '1' for the right image.  Larger numbers are\n        also allowed if you need more than two views.\n        \"\"\"\n        if loaderOptions is None:\n            loaderOptions = LoaderOptions()\n        else:\n            loaderOptions = LoaderOptions(loaderOptions)\n        if multiview is not None:\n            flags = loaderOptions.getTextureFlags()\n            if multiview:\n                flags |= LoaderOptions.TFMultiview\n            else:\n                flags &= ~LoaderOptions.TFMultiview\n            loaderOptions.setTextureFlags(flags)",
