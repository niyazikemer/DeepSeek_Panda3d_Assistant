  "content": "The chunk discusses the impact of instancing on rendering and culling processes, followed by the introduction of NodePath as a solution for managing ambiguous node queries.\n\n**Context:**\n\nAfter explaining how instancing multiplies the number of rendered objects without reducing polygon count, the text details each instance's separate handling in terms of bounding boxes and culling. It then introduces NodePath to address the ambiguity of querying nodes present in multiple locations.\n\nNote that each instance has its own bounding box, each is occlusion-culled and frustum-culled separately.\n\nThe NodePath: a Pointer to a Node plus a Unique Instance ID\n\nIf I had a pointer to the chorus-line dancer model, and I tried to ask the question \"where is the dancer,\" there would be no well-defined answer. The dancer is not in one place, she is in 150 places. Because of this, the data type pointer to node does not have a method that retrieves the net transform.",
