  "content": "This chunk is situated within a section explaining Panda3D's filename syntax conventions, providing examples of correct and incorrect ways to use Panda-style filenames when calling Panda3D's API in both Python and C++. It emphasizes the importance of using forward slashes and converting Windows-style paths to ensure portability across different operating systems.\n\n# RIGHT:\nloader.loadModel(\"/c/Program Files/My Game/Models/Model1.egg\")\n\ncpp\n\n# WRONG:\nwindow->load_model(framework.get_models(), \"c:\\\\Program Files\\\\My Game\\\\Models\\\\Model1.egg\");\n\n# RIGHT:\nwindow->load_model(framework.get_models(), \"/c/Program Files/My Game/Models/Model1.egg\");\n\nPanda uses the .Filename class to store Panda-style filenames; many Panda functions expect a Filename object as a parameter. The Filename class also contains several useful methods for path manipulation and file access, as well as for converting between Windows-style filenames and Panda-style filenames; see the .Filename page in the API Reference for a more complete list.",
