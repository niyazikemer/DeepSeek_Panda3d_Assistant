  "content": "The provided code chunk appears to be part of an object traversal mechanism within a larger system for managing and tracking object references and containers. Specifically, it is likely situated within a method that iterates through container references (`curObjRef`) while handling potential exceptions (e.g., if a container reference becomes invalid or inaccessible). The code includes debugging notifications and resets the current object reference (`curObjRef = None`) when an exception occurs, allowing the traversal process to continue from another container. This mechanism is likely part of a system designed for memory management, leak detection, or resource tracking, where maintaining valid references and gracefully handling failures are critical.\n\ntry:\n                    for curObj in curObjRef.getContainerGen():\n                        yield None\n                except Exception:\n                    self.notify.debug('lost current container, ref.getContainerGen() failed')\n                    # that container is gone, try again\n                    curObjRef = None\n                    continue\n\n                self.notify.debug('--> %s' % curObjRef)\n                #import pdb;pdb.set_trace()\n\n                # store a copy of the current objRef\n                parentObjRef = curObjRef\n                # if we hit a dead end, start over from another container\n                curObjRef = None",
