This follows an explanation of default pipe availability and configurations, providing guidance on enhancing applications by allowing multiple rendering options.\n\n```plaintext\nAfter explaining the default graphics pipe setup and Config.prc variables determining available pipes, this section details how to create and manage extra graphics pipes for scenarios like switching between OpenGL and DirectX in a game.\n```\n\nYou can create additional graphics pipes, for instance to provide an in-game interface to switch between OpenGL and DirectX rendering. The easiest way to do this is to call base.makeAllPipes(). Then you can walk through the list of GraphicsPipes in base.pipeList to see all of the available GraphicsPipes available in particular environment.\n\nWhen you walk through the GraphicsPipes in base.pipeList, you can call the following interface methods on each one:",
