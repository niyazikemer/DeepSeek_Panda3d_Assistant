  "content": "The document discusses how the Rigid Body Combiner helps reduce the number of nodes sent to the graphics card, even with moving objects, addressing the common issue of too many meshes in complex game scenes when traditional flattening methods aren't sufficient.\n\nThe Rigid Body Combiner\n\nWhen you are developing a complex game, you will most likely run into the problem that you will have too many meshes <too-many-meshes> in your scene. Panda3D's flattening methods can help you reducing the number of nodes, but often when you have hundreds of moving bodies this is not always an option. Therefore, Panda3D has a feature to help you reduce the number of nodes, even if they are moving: the .RigidBodyCombiner.",
