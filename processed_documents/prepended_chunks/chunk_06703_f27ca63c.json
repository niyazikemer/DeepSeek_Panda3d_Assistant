  "content": "The chunk discusses adjusting platform tags in setup.py for compatibility with newer Python versions and third-party packages, like numpy, which no longer support older platforms such as manylinux1 or macOS 10.6.\n\n'platforms': ['manylinux1_x86_64', 'macosx_10_6_x86_64', 'win_amd64'],\n\nOn more recent versions of Python, newer defaults are used. See the list below for details.\n\nSometimes, it is desirable to use third-party packages that do not provide wheels for a given platform. For example, the latest version of numpy no longer publishes wheels for manylinux1_x86_64 or macosx_10_6_x86_64. If you wish to use the latest version of numpy, then you need to therefore set the platform tags to increase these versions:\n\n'platforms': ['manylinux2010_x86_64', 'macosx_10_9_x86_64', 'win_amd64'],",
