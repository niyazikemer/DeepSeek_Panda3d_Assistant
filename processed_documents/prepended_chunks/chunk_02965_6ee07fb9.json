  "content": "This chunk appears to belong in a class or module responsible for managing 2D textures on a canvas. The code handles dynamic texture memory limits, adjusts the canvas height based on these limits, and ensures proper initialization of the canvas background. It is situated within a method or function that initializes or updates texture cards, likely after setting initial parameters but before finalizing the canvas appearance.\n\nThe context involves managing texture resources efficiently, preventing excessive memory usage while maintaining visual quality. The code ensures textures are prepared correctly for rendering by adjusting memory limits and canvas dimensions as needed.\n\nif self.dynamicLimit:\n            # Choose a suitable limit by rounding to the next power of two.\n            limit = 1\n            while limit < self.totalSize:\n                limit *= 2\n            self.limit = limit\n\n        # Set our GSG to limit itself to no more textures than we\n        # expect to display onscreen, so we don't go crazy with\n        # texture memory.\n        self.win.getGsg().getPreparedObjects().setGraphicsMemoryLimit(self.limit)\n\n        # The actual height of the canvas, including the overflow\n        # area.
