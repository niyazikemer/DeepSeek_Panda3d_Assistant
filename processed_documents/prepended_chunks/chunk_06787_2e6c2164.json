  "content": "The chunk pertains to GLX configuration settings that control how OpenGL extensions are utilized under the X Window System. It includes parameters for enabling advanced visual configurations (FBConfig), offscreen rendering methods (pbuffers and pixmaps), and managing OpenGL extension functions, crucial for optimizing graphics performance and compatibility with X-based systems.\n\nfor some reason. glx-get-proc-address bool 1 Set this to true to allow the use of glxGetProcAddress(), if it is\navailable, to query the OpenGL extension functions. This is the standard\nway to query extension functions. glx-support-fbconfig bool 1 Set this true to enable the use of the advanced FBConfig interface\n(as opposed to the older XVisual interface) if it is available, to\nselect a graphics visual and create an OpenGL context. glx-support-pbuffer bool 1 Set this true to enable the use of X pbuffer-based offscreen\nbuffers, if available. This is usually preferred over pixmap-based\nbuffers, but not all drivers support them. glx-support-pixmap bool 0 Set this true to enable the use of X pixmap-based offscreen buffers.\nThis is false by default because pixmap-based buffers are usually slower\nthan pbuffer-based buffers. graphics-memory-limit int -1 This is a default limit that is imposed on each GSG at GSG creation\ntime. It limits the total amount of graphics memory, including texture",
