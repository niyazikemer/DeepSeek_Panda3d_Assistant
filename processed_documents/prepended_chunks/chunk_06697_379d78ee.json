  "content": "The chunk explains how Panda3D handles binary storage during the build process and distinguishes between GUI and console applications, focusing on their behavior across different operating systems, particularly Windows and macOS, emphasizing logging requirements for error visibility in GUI apps.\n\nThe resulting binaries will be stored in the build folder with one sub-folder per targeted platform, together with all the requisite files needed to run the application.\n\nGUI and Console Apps\n\nIt is possible to build two kinds of executables, gui_apps and console_apps. This distinction is especially important on Windows and macOS, whereas there is no difference on other operating systems.\n\nGUI apps are expected to be run from a file browser, start menu or straight from the desktop. They communicate back to the user via graphical windows, not via command-line output. On Windows, it is necessary to build as a GUI app to avoid a Command Prompt being opened when run. However, there is no command-line output at all on Windows or macOS when run as a GUI app! To be able to see error messages, you must set up logging to a file via log_filename, such as in the example above.",
