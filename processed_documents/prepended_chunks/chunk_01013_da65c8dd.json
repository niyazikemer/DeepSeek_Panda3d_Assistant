  "content": "This code chunk demonstrates how to create an animation control panel (AnimPanel) for managing animations of two Actor objects (`a` and `a2`) created using the `Actor` class from the `direct.actor` module. The example shows alternative methods for initializing the AnimPanel, either by passing a list of actors directly or by calling the `animPanel()` method on each actor instance individually. This is useful for testing and controlling animations in a Panda3D application.\n\nap = AnimPanel.AnimPanel([a, a2])\n\n# Alternately\nap = a.animPanel()\nap2 = a2.animPanel()\n\n\"\"\"",
