  "content": "The provided chunk addresses a problem in animation or interval handling within Panda3D where excessively long frames can cause missed updates. The solution involves manipulating the global clock to ensure accurate timing, preventing skipped frames and maintaining smooth animations.\n\nTo help you understand how to implement this solution, here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Long Frames**: Recognize when your code is causing a frame to take an unusually long time. This could be due to heavy computations or complex operations within the frame.\n\n2. **Reset Frame Time**: After completing the slow operation, reset the global clock by setting its frame time to the current real time using `globalClock.setFrameTime(globalClock.getRealTime())`. This ensures that the next frame starts correctly without skipping any animation steps.\n\n3. **Apply Globally or Locally**: Decide whether this adjustment should be applied globally for all frames or only during specific long frames where it's needed.\n\nBy following these steps, you can prevent animation glitches and ensure smoother performance in your Panda3D application.\n\nThe problem is when you have a single really long frame. In this case, anything you do at the end of this long frame is considered to have actually happened at the beginning of the frame, and when the next frame rolls around (after some considerable time has elapsed from the previous frame), Panda has to skip over all of the intervening time to catch up, and you miss seeing some part or all of your interval or animation.\n\nThere are several easy solutions. One is to munge the clock while you're computing your slow frame so that it doesn't actually allow time to advance during this period, by putting this line after your loop, etc.\n\nglobalClock.setFrameTime(globalClock.getRealTime())\n\nThis simply resets the \"frame time\" to whatever the current real time is towards the end of your long frame. This will break the atomic-frame rule for (only) that one frame, but in this case that's what you want to happen.",
