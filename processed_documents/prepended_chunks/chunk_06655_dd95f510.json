  "content": "This section explains how Panda handles models with multiple texture coordinate sets, also known as UV sets. It discusses how each set can have its own name and that the default is unnamed. The document covers how to specify which texture uses a particular set via `TextureStage.set_...` and warns against incorrect method usage to prevent unintended behavior. This allows applying different textures independently on the same model, enhancing visual complexity.\n\nMultiple Texture Coordinate Sets\n\nIn addition to simple texture transforms, it is also possible to have more than one set of texture coordinates on a model. Panda allows you to define as many different sets of texture coordinates as you like, and each set can be completely unrelated to all of the others.\n\nWhen you have multiple texture coordinate sets (sometimes called multiple UV sets) on a model, each set will have its own name, which is any arbitrary string. The default texture coordinate set has no name (its name is the empty string).\n\nNormally, you create multiple texture coordinate sets in the same modeling package that you use to create the model. Not all modeling packages, and not all Panda converters, support multiple texture coordinates.\n\nIf you happen to have a model with multiple texture coordinate sets, you can specify which set a particular texture should use by calling TextureStage.set_texcoord_name(\"name\") <.TextureStage.set_texcoord_name>.\n\nWarning",
