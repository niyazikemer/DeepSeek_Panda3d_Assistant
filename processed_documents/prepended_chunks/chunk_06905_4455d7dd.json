  "content": "This chunk provides an example of applying texture transforms to adjust the position and scale of a decal image on a model's face while leaving another texture unaffected. It demonstrates the use of `setTexScale` and `setTexOffset` methods within a specific `TextureStage`, showcasing how multiple textures can have independent transformations even when sharing the same coordinates.\n\n```plaintext\nThis chunk illustrates how to apply independent texture transforms using setTexScale and setTexOffset within a TextureStage, demonstrating that each texture can be adjusted separately on a model.\n```\n\nand the resulting texture:\n\nIn the above example, we have applied a scale of (8, 4) to reduce the size of the decal image substantially, and then we specified an offset of (-4, -2) to slide it around in the positive (u, v) direction to smiley's face (since the (0, 0) coordinate happens to be on smiley's backside). However, these operations affect only the decal image; the original smiley texture is unchanged from its normal position, even though both textures are using the same texture coordinates.",
