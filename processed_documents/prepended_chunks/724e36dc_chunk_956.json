  "content": "The provided code chunk implements a method `selectNodePathNamed` that handles selecting a specific node path by name within an interactive 3D scene graph editor or similar application. The method manages node path selection logic by checking if the named node exists in a dictionary of known node paths, dynamically evaluating the name string as a NodePath object if necessary, and ensuring invalid entries are cleared from UI components like listboxes. This functionality is part of an object-oriented system that maintains a collection of node paths, allowing for interactive manipulation via user interface elements such as selection menus and checkboxes.\n\ndef selectNodePathNamed(self, name):\n        # See if node path has already been selected\n        nodePath = self.nodePathDict.get(name, None)\n        # If not, see if listbox evals into a node path\n        if nodePath is None:\n            # See if this evaluates into a node path\n            try:\n                nodePath = eval(name)\n                if isinstance(nodePath, NodePath):\n                    self.addNodePath(nodePath)\n                else:\n                    # Good eval but not a node path, give up\n                    nodePath = None\n            except Exception:\n                # Bogus eval\n                nodePath = None\n                # Clear bogus entry from listbox\n                listbox = self.nodePathMenu.component('scrolledlist')\n                listbox.setlist(self.nodePathNames)\n        # Did we finally get something?\n        if nodePath is not None:\n            # Yes, select it!\n            ShowBaseGlobal.direct.select(nodePath)",
