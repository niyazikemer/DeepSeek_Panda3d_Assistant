  "content": "The `selectRefNodePathNamed` method is part of the `Placer` class, which manages node placement in a 3D environment. This method handles selecting a reference node path by name, supporting special cases like 'self', 'selected', and 'parent', and evaluates expressions for custom nodes. It fits within the Placer's functionality, aiding in relative object positioning.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe `selectRefNodePathNamed` method is situated within the `Placer` class, which facilitates node placement by managing reference node paths. This method determines a reference node path based on a given name, handling special cases and evaluating expressions to locate custom nodes for accurate placement.\n\ndef selectRefNodePathNamed(self, name):\n        nodePath = None\n        if name == 'self':\n            nodePath = self.tempCS\n        elif name == 'selected':\n            nodePath = ShowBaseGlobal.direct.selected.last\n            # Add Combo box entry for this selected object\n            self.addRefNodePath(nodePath)\n        elif name == 'parent':\n            nodePath = self['nodePath'].getParent()\n        else:\n            nodePath = self.refNodePathDict.get(name, None)\n            if nodePath is None:\n                # See if this evaluates into a node path\n                try:\n                    nodePath = eval(name)\n                    if isinstance(nodePath, NodePath):\n                        self.addRefNodePath(nodePath)\n                    else:\n                        # Good eval but not a node path, give up\n                        nodePath = None\n                except Exception:\n                    # Bogus eval\n                    nodePath = None",
