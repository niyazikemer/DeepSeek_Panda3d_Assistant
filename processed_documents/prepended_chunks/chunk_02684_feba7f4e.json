  "content": "This chunk provides a visual representation of the state transitions within the `FourStateOnOff` class, illustrating how the states (0-4) interact and transition between each other in the context of the state machine described in the code. The diagram shows the flow of state changes, with specific focus on the \"on\" and \"off\" states, and how they are interconnected.\n\nHere is a diagram showing the where the names from the list\n        are used::\n\n            +---------+\n            | 0 (off) |----> (any other state and vice versa).\n            +---------+\n\n                       +--------+\n                    -->| 4 (on) |---\n                   |   +--------+   |\n                   |                |\n                   |                v\n             +---------+       +---------+\n             | 3 (off) |<----->| 1 (off) |\n             +---------+       +---------+\n                   ^                |\n                   |                |\n                   |  +---------+   |\n                    --| 2 (off) |<--\n                      +---------+",
