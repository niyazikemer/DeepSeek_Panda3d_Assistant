This was done so if either this node or the collider is\n        removed from the scene graph (e.g. avatar teleport), the phased\n        object will clean itself up automatically.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    notify = directNotify.newCategory(\"DistancePhasedObject\")\n    __InstanceSequence = 0\n    __InstanceDeque: list[int] = []",
