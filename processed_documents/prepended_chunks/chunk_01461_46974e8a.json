  "content": "This chunk describes key configuration options for customizing the appearance of OnscreenText instances in Panda3D. The properties include background color (bg), shadow effects, frame styling, text alignment, word wrapping behavior, and drawing order priority within the rendering hierarchy. These settings allow developers to control how on-screen text is displayed and layered relative to other UI elements. Each property has corresponding getter and setter methods defined earlier in the document.\n\nbg: the (r, g, b, a) background color of the text.  If the\n              fourth value, a, is nonzero, a card is created to place\n              behind the text and set to the given color.\n\n          shadow: the (r, g, b, a) color of the shadow behind the text.\n              If the fourth value, a, is nonzero, a little drop shadow\n              is created and placed behind the text.\n\n          frame: the (r, g, b, a) color of the frame drawn around the\n              text.  If the fourth value, a, is nonzero, a frame is\n              created around the text.\n\n          align: one of TextNode.ALeft, TextNode.ARight, or TextNode.ACenter.\n\n          wordwrap: either the width to wordwrap the text at, or None\n              to specify no automatic word wrapping.\n\n          drawOrder: the drawing order of this text with respect to\n              all other things in the 'fixed' bin within render2d.\n              The text will actually use drawOrder through drawOrder +\n              2.",
