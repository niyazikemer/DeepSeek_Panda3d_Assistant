  "content": "This chunk discusses the scenarios where enabling a multithreaded render pipeline provides limited benefits due to high performance or an uneven distribution of processing time across different stages. It highlights the importance of considering application-specific characteristics before implementing such optimizations.\n\n```plaintext\nContext:\nThe document explains how to optimize rendering by using a multithreaded approach, but this chunk emphasizes that the gain may be minimal if the app is already fast (60fps+) or heavily skewed towards one processing stage.\n```\n\nif the application is already running fast (60fps or above), then the gain from parallelization is likely to be dwarfed by the additional overhead requirements. And, of course, if your application is very one-sided, such that almost all of its time is spent in App (or, conversely, almost all of its time is spent in Draw), then you will not see much benefit from this trick.",
