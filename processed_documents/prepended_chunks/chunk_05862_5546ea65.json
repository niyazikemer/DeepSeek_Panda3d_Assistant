  "content": "The document explains how to change text properties in the middle of a paragraph by defining, registering, and referencing custom TextProperties objects using special characters in text strings.\n\nRegistering the new TextProperties objects\n\nYou will need a pointer to the global .TextPropertiesManager object:\n\ntpMgr = TextPropertiesManager.getGlobalPtr()\n\nAfter you have created your TextProperties objects, you must register each one with the TextPropertiesManager, under a unique name:\n\ntpMgr.setProperties(\"red\", tpRed)\ntpMgr.setProperties(\"slant\", tpSlant)\ntpMgr.setProperties(\"roman\", tpRoman)\n\nReferencing the TextProperties in text strings\n\nNow you're ready to put the special characters in your text string to activate these mode changes. To do this, you will use the special character '\\1', or the ASCII 0x01 character. You use the \\1 character twice, as a kind of quotation mark before and after the name you have used above to register your TextProperties object, e.g. '\\1red\\1' to activate tpRed, or '\\1slant\\1' to activate tpSlant.",
