  "content": "The chunk is part of a method in a Python script that handles file copying with dependency management during the application build process. This code ensures that required files are properly copied into the build directory while managing dependencies and issuing warnings for missing files.\n\n**Context:**\nThis code is part of a function within a command (likely `bdist_apps` or similar) responsible for handling file dependencies during the distribution building process. It searches for specific files in designated directories, copies them with their dependencies, handles cases where dependencies are missing by excluding them in future builds, and issues warnings for such occurrences.\n\nfor dir in search_path:\n            if os.path.isdir(dir):\n                files = os.listdir(dir)\n                files_lower = [file.lower() for file in files]\n\n                if name_lower in files_lower:\n                    name = files[files_lower.index(name_lower)]\n                    source_path = os.path.join(dir, name)\n                    target_path = os.path.join(target_dir, name)\n                    self.copy_with_dependencies(source_path, target_path, search_path)\n\n        # Warn if we can't find it, but only once.\n        self.warn(\"could not find dependency {0} (referenced by {1})\".format(name, referenced_by))\n        self.exclude_dependencies.append(p3d.GlobPattern(name.lower()))\n\n    def copy(self, source_path, target_path):\n        \"\"\" Copies source_path to target_path.\n\n        source_path may be located inside a .whl file. \"\"\"",
