  "content": "The chunk introduces the `flywheel` function, part of a suite of utility tools, designed to create custom sequence generators. This function leverages `makeFlywheelGen` to produce sequences by cycling through lists with specified counts, exemplified in its docstring. Situated among other functions like `loopGen` and profiling tools such as `quickProfile`, it serves as a specialized generator within the document's collection of Python utilities for data manipulation and analysis.\n\ndef flywheel(*args, **kArgs):\n    # create a flywheel generator\n    # see arguments and comments in flywheelGen above\n    # example usage:\n    \"\"\"\n    >>> for i in flywheel([1,2,3], countList=[10, 5, 1]):\n    ...   print i,\n    ...\n    1 2 3 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1\n    \"\"\"\n    for flywheel in makeFlywheelGen(*args, **kArgs):\n        pass\n    return flywheel\n\n\nif __debug__:\n    def quickProfile(name=\"unnamed\"):\n        import pstats\n\n        def profileDecorator(f):\n            if not ConfigVariableBool(\"use-profiler\", False):\n                return f",
