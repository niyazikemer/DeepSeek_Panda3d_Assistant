  "content": "The chunk is situated within a discussion about exporting animation and geometry data from Maya using maya2egg. It explains how to choose between separate or combined file exports for optimization purposes in game development.\n\nLastly, if you want all the geometry, joints, and skinning data exported to your egg in one file select \u201cboth\u201d from the Animation box. This file type is rarely used, but special cases exist. Most of the time you would want to keep the animation and geometry data in separate files. This allows you to load animations on the fly inside the engine without having to load the geometry data twice. Thus making your game load (and possibly run) faster.",
