  "content": "The chunk is a code snippet from a Python application framework that provides methods for managing graphical rendering settings and user interface controls. The specific method `setupMouse` within the `WindowControls` class enables creating multiple mouse watchers to support monitoring mouse input across multiple windows. This feature allows applications to handle scenarios where multiple windows need independent mouse interaction, such as in multi-windowed editors or debuggers.\n\nThe code chunk is situated within a larger document that includes functionality for managing camera views, rendering settings, and user interface controls. The `setupMouse` method is part of the `WindowControls` class, which encapsulates information necessary for multiwindow support, including handling mouse input across multiple windows.\n\n# [gjeon] now you can create multiple mouse watchers to support multiple windows\n    def setupMouse(self, win, fMultiWin=False):\n        \"\"\"\n        Creates the structures necessary to monitor the mouse input,\n        using the indicated window.  If the mouse has already been set\n        up for a different window, those structures are deleted first.\n\n        :param fMultiWin: If True, then the previous mouse structures are not\n                          deleted; instead, multiple windows are allowed to\n                          monitor the mouse input.  However, in this case, the\n                          trackball controls are not set up, and must be set up\n                          by hand if desired.",
