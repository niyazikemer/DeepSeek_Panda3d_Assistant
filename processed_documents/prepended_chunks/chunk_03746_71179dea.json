  "content": "This code chunk is part of a method within a Python class that extends `Pmw.ApplicationShell`, specifically for creating an `OptionMenu` widget using the Pmw (Python Mega Widgets) library. The context involves initializing, configuring, and packing the `OptionMenu`, setting its command callback, binding help text, and recording both the widget and associated variable in a structured manner within the application shell framework.\n\n# Create widget\n        widget = Pmw.OptionMenu(parent, **kw)\n        # Do this after so command isn't called on widget creation\n        widget['command'] = command\n        # Pack widget\n        widget.pack(side = side, fill = fill, expand = expand)\n        # Bind help\n        self.bind(widget.component('menubutton'), help)\n        # Record widget and variable\n        self.addWidget(category, text, widget)\n        self.addVariable(category, text, variable)\n        return widget",
