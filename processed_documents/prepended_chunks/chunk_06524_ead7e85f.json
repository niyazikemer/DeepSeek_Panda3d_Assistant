  "content": "This section discusses several key global components and services provided by Panda3D, including job management, event handling, messaging, logging, and timing utilities.\n\nThe global job manager, as imported from direct.showbase.JobManagerGlobal.\n\nThe global event manager, as imported from direct.showbase.EventManagerGlobal.\n\nThe global messenger, imported from direct.showbase.MessengerGlobal, is responsible for event handling <event-handlers>. The most commonly used method of this object is perhaps messenger.send(\"event\") <direct.showbase.Messenger.Messenger.send>, which dispatches a custom event.\n\nThe global bulletin board, as imported from direct.showbase.BulletinBoardGlobal.\n\nThe default Panda3D output stream for notifications and logging, as a short-hand for Notify.out() <panda3d.core.Notify.out>.\n\nThe clock object used by default for timing information, a short-hand for ClockObject.getGlobalClock() <panda3d.core.ClockObject.getGlobalClock>.\n\nThe most common use is to obtain the time elapsed since the last frame (for calculations in movement code), using globalClock.dt <panda3d.core.ClockObject.dt>. The value is given in seconds.",
