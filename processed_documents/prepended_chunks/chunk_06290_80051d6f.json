  "content": "The chunk provides an overview of running Maya's exporter using either command-line utilities or graphical panels, detailing specific commands for different Maya versions and demonstrating with an example file structure. This information is situated within a guide explaining how to export models from Maya, covering both command-line usage and integration into Maya's interface.\n\n**Context:**  \nThis section explains how to run the Maya exporter, whether through the command line or a graphical tool, including examples of commands for specific Maya versions and file structures.\n\nRunning the Exporter\n\nMaya's exporter can be run from the command prompt or via a graphical panel. The command line utility is called maya2egg. There are multiple versions of it corresponding to different versions of maya. For instance, the version to use for Maya 5.0 is maya2egg5, for 6.0 its maya2egg6 and for 6.5 its maya2egg65.\n\nThe following is an example of how to convert a file(maya binary .mb) if using Maya 6.0 through the command line.\n\nThe egg file will contain the filenames of the textures. These texture pathnames will be stored as relative paths, relative to the location of the egg file. For example, let's say that the files are laid out like this:\n\nc:\\My Models\\Maya Files\\Character.mb\nc:\\My Models\\Egg Files\\Character.egg\nc:\\My Models\\Textures\\Character.png\n\nIn that case, the command to export the model is:\n\nc:\\\ncd c:\\My Models\\\nmaya2egg -o \"Egg Files/Character.egg\" \"Maya Files/Character.mb\"",
