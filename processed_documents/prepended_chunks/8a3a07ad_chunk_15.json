  "content": "The `BufferedDistancePhasedNode` class extends the `DistancePhasedNode` class to add support for specifying buffer distances for each phase. This allows you to avoid \"phase flicker\" by adjusting the effective distance when entering or leaving a phase, using parameters defined in the `bufferParamMap`.\n\nclass BufferedDistancePhasedNode(DistancePhasedNode):\n    \"\"\"\n    This class is similar to DistancePhasedNode except you can also\n    specify a buffer distance for each phase.  Upon entering that phase,\n    its distance will be increased by the buffer amount.  Conversely,\n    the distance will be decremented by that amount, back to its\n    original size, upon leaving.  In this manner, you can avoid the problem\n    of 'phase flicker' as someone repeatedly steps across a static phase\n    border.\n\n    You specify the buffer amount in the bufferParamMap parameter\n    to :meth:`__init__()`.  It has this format::\n\n        bufferParamMap = {'alias':(distance, bufferAmount), ...}\n    \"\"\"\n    notify = directNotify.newCategory(\"BufferedDistancePhasedObject\")",
