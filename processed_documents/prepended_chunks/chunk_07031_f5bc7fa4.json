  "content": "The provided chunk discusses Panda3D's built-in decal capabilities and introduces blend mode as a texture blending technique that allows runtime color specification but requires grayscale textures without alpha.\n\nPanda3D also provides a built-in decal capability, for rendering a small polygon coplanar with and embedded within a larger polygon, which is not related to the decal texture blend mode.\n\nBlend mode\n\nBlend mode is similar to decal mode, except you can specify the color of the decal as a parameter at runtime. You can vary the color and you don't have to have a different texture image prepared for each possible color. However, the decal will always be monochromatic (it will be drawn in different shades of whatever color you specify).\n\nBlend mode can only be used with a grayscale texture, and it does not use alpha. Since the sample texture above is not a grayscale texture, we will use a different texture for this example:",
