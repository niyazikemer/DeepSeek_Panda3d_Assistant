  "content": "The chunk provides a practical example demonstrating how to selectively apply a new texture (blue) to specific parts of a car model without affecting other parts that require different textures, such as tires. This context follows an explanation of applying textures using NodePath and highlights the importance of targeting specific geometry components when working with complex models and multiple texture maps.\n\nFor the most part, this car was painted with one big texture image, which looks like this:\n\nBut we also have a blue version of the same texture image:\n\nAlthough it is tempting to use .NodePath.set_texture() to assign the blue texture to the whole car, that would also assign the blue texture to the car's tires, which need to use a different texture map. So instead, we apply the blue texture just to the pieces that we want to change:\n\npython\n\ncar = loader.loadModel('bvw-f2004--carnsx/carnsx.egg')\nblue = loader.loadTexture('bvw-f2004--carnsx/carnsx-blue.png')\ncar.find('**/body/body').setTexture(blue, 1)\ncar.find('**/body/polySurface1').setTexture(blue, 1)\ncar.find('**/body/polySurface2').setTexture(blue, 1)\n\ncpp",
