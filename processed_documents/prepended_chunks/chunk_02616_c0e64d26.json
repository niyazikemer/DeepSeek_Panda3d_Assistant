  "content": "This chunk is part of the ClassicFSM (Classic State Machine) implementation, specifically within the `request` method, which manages state transitions between different states in a finite state machine. The highlighted code checks whether a requested transition from the current state to a target state is explicitly defined or allowed based on the system's configuration for handling undefined transitions (`onUndefTransition`). If undefined transitions are set to be allowed, it enables the transition and issues a warning notification about the undefined action.\n\n# is the transition defined? if it isn't, should we allow it?\n        transitionDefined = self.__currentState.isTransitionDefined(aStateName)\n        transitionAllowed = transitionDefined\n\n        if self.onUndefTransition == ClassicFSM.ALLOW:\n            transitionAllowed = 1\n            if not transitionDefined:\n                # the transition is not defined, but we're going to do it\n                # anyway. print a warning.\n                ClassicFSM.notify.warning(\n                    \"[%s]: performing undefined transition from %s to %s\" %\n                    (self.__name,\n                     self.__currentState.getName(),\n                     aStateName))",
