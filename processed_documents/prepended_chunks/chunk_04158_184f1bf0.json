  "content": "The given chunk is situated within the `InputState` class, which manages input states through event watching and forced values. The comment highlights a decision to avoid modifying an input state upon ignoring it, while the `force` method demonstrates how to enforce a specific value for a state using tokens. This ensures consistent management of input behavior without unintended side effects.\n\n# I commented this out because we shouldn't be modifying an\n        # input state simply because we're not looking at it anymore.\n        # self.set(name, False, inputSource)\n\n    def force(self, name, value, inputSource):\n        \"\"\"\n        Force isSet(name) to return 'value'.\n\n        This returns a token; hold onto the token and call token.release() when\n        you no longer want to force the state.\n\n        Example::",
