  "content": "The document describes built-in global variables provided by the ShowBase class in Panda3D applications, explaining their purposes and usage. The chunk situates within this list, detailing additional variables including those for accessing distribution info, inspecting objects, deprecated config access, and a legacy task loop function.\n\n**Context:**\n\nThe chunk is part of a comprehensive list outlining global variables available in Panda3D when using ShowBase, each serving specific functionalities like system information, object inspection tools, deprecated interfaces, and legacy task management.\n\nProvides information about the Panda3D distribution, such as the version, compiler information and build settings. Short-hand for PandaSystem.getGlobalPtr() <panda3d.core.PandaSystem.getGlobalPtr>.\n\nShort-hand for direct.tkpanels.Inspector.inspect(), which opens up a GUI panel for inspecting an object's properties.\n\nSee inspection-utilities.\n\nThe deprecated ~direct.showbase.DConfig interface for accessing config variables <accessing-config-vars-in-a-program>.\n\nCalls the task manager main loop, which runs indefinitely. This is a deprecated short-hand for base.run() <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.run>.\n\nSee main-loop.",
