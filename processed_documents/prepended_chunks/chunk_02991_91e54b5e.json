  "content": "The provided code is part of a class called `TexManager` that manages texture placements using bitmasks for efficient memory allocation and collision detection. The methods `Pack`, `findLargestHole`, and `findAvailableHoles` are used to determine optimal placement locations for textures within allocated regions while avoiding overlaps. The chunk specifically deals with backtracking when a placement fails, finding the largest available hole, and efficiently searching for suitable placement areas based on area or dimensions constraints.\n\n# Keep going.\n            area -= tpArea\n            result.append(tp)\n            tp.setBitmasks(self.bitmasks)\n            self.texPlacements[tp] = None\n\n        # Huh, not enough room, or no more holes.\n        self.texPlacements = savedTexPlacements\n        self.bitmasks = savedBitmasks\n        return None\n\n    def findLargestHole(self):\n        holes = self.findAvailableHoles(0)\n        if holes:\n            return max(holes, key=lambda hole: hole[0])[1]\n        return None\n\n    def findAvailableHoles(self, area, w = None, h = None):\n        \"\"\" Finds a list of available holes, of at least the indicated\n        area.
