  "content": "\"\"\"\nThis chunk is part of a comprehensive guide explaining various properties of a lens in Panda3D. Specifically, it focuses on the field of view (FOV), detailing how to adjust it using `set_fov`, the impact of different FOV values on perspective distortion, and the typical constraints for realistic rendering. The section also highlights the default FOV value of 40 degrees and its implications for comfortable viewing.\n\"\"\"\n\nB. This angle is the field of view, or fov, of the lens. You can easily change this by setting a new value in degrees with lens.set_fov(angle) <.Lens.set_fov>. Making the field of view smaller will bring things in closer, like a telephoto lens; it will also diminish the visible effects of perspective. Making the field of view larger will open up the view to more objects, like a wide-angle lens; it will also increase the visible distortion of perspective. The field of view must be greater than 0 degrees and less than 180, but values greater than 90 will seem extremely distorted. (In the real world, perspective lenses rarely go wider than 80 degrees, and that's pretty wide.) The default field of view is 40 degrees, which is usually a pretty comfortable viewing angle.",
