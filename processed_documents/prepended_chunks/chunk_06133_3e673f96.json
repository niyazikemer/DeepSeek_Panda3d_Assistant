  "content": "The chunk provides specific details about enabling sRGB encoding to ensure accurate color representation and configuring HDR rendering in Panda3D, including considerations for framebuffer settings, texture formats, and tonemapping.\n\nWhen enabling this, it is important to make sure that all color input textures are properly configured to use the sRGB format, to prevent them from appearing too bright and washed-out.\n\nIf the framebuffer-srgb setting is active, this filter is unnecessary. Panda will detect if this is the case and refuse to apply this filter, in order to prevent double-applying the sRGB transformation.\n\nfilters.setSrgbEncode()\nfilters.delSrgbEncode()\n\nThis filter is available as of Panda3D 1.10.7.\n\nThe High Dynamic Range Filter\n\nThis filter enables High Dynamic Range rendering. This will enable the use of a floating-point framebuffer format and disables clamping of the color values before they are written to the framebuffer. This allows you to use far greater brightness values on your lights, which creates a greater dynamic range in your scene. A tonemapping filter (ACES) is used to bring the values back into the appropriate range for display on a monitor.",
