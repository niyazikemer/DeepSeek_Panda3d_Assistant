Each entry provides licensing information and usage notes to help developers understand their roles within the Panda3D ecosystem.\n```\n\nLicense: GNU LGPL\n\nOpenAL Soft\n\nhttps://openal-soft.org\n\nThe Open Audio Library is a free alternative to FMOD and supports nearly the same features, including 3D surround sound. We ship the OpenAL Soft implementation by default on Windows. It can be easily removed from the distribution.\n\nLicense: LGPL\n\nCg Toolkit\n\nhttps://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit\n\nNvidia's Cg Toolkit is required for Panda's Cg support. At the moment, it cannot be removed without recompiling Panda3D from source code.\n\nLicense: Proprietary\n\nLicense note: Required to use the Panda3D Shader Generator, which utilizes Nvidia Cg.\n\nEigen\n\nhttp://eigen.tuxfamily.org/\n\nOptimized linear algebra library. Optional, but improves performance of matrix operations significantly.\n\nLicense: MPL2\n\nlibsquish\n\nhttps://code.google.com/archive/p/libsquish/",
