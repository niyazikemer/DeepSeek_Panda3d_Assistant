  "content": "To create a 2D scene graph in Panda3D similar to `render2d` but for a secondary window or buffer:\n\n1. **Create a new DisplayRegion** with a higher sort value (e.g., 20) so it renders after the main region, allowing 2D elements to layer over 3D content.\n\n2. **Set up an Orthographic camera**:\n   - Create a `NodePath` for the camera.\n   - Use an `OrthographicLens` with a wide near/far clipping range (e.g., -1000 to 1000) to accommodate all on-screen elements.\n\n3. **Configure the camera and attach to scene root**:\n   - Attach the Orthographic camera to a new node (`myRender2d`).\n   - Disable depth testing and writing on `myRender2d` since 2D rendering doesn't need these features.\n\n4. **Handle GUI elements (if needed)**:\n   - Create a `PGTop` node scaled by aspect ratio for proper mouse interaction.\n   - Attach a `MouseWatcher` to handle input, especially if using a different window.\n\nThis setup allows you to render 2D content over 3D scenes in a secondary window efficiently.\n\nNodePath myRender2d(\"myRender2d\");\nmyRender2d.set_depth_test(false);\nmyRender2d.set_depth_write(false);\nmyCamera2d.reparent_to(myRender2d);\ndr->set_camera(myCamera2d)\n\nThe first group of commands creates a new DisplayRegion on the window and sets its sort value to 20, so that it will be drawn after the main DisplayRegion has been drawn. This is important in order to layer text on top of the 3-D scene, of course.\n\nThe second group of commands creates a camera with an OrthographicLens. The lens is created with a wide near/far clipping plane: -1000 to 1000. This probably doesn't matter too much since we expect that everything we parent to this scene graph will have a Y value of 0 (which is easily between -1000 and 1000), but this allows us to accept a wide range of Y values.",
