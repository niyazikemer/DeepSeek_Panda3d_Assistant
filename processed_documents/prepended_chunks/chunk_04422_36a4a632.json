  "content": "This chunk defines methods in a class for managing textures and sounds. The first method (`unloadTexture`) releases a previously loaded texture from memory by calling `TexturePool.releaseTexture()`. The second method (`loadSfx`) is used to load sound effects specifically using the sfxManager, distinguishing sound effects from music files by utilizing different audio managers.\n\nThe texture parameter may be the return value of any previous\n        call to loadTexture(), load3DTexture(), or loadCubeMap().\n        \"\"\"\n        assert Loader.notify.debug(\"Unloading texture: %s\" % (texture))\n        TexturePool.releaseTexture(texture)\n\n    # sound loading funcs\n    def loadSfx(self, *args, **kw):\n        \"\"\"Loads one or more sound files, specifically designated as a\n        \"sound effect\" file (that is, uses the sfxManager to load the\n        sound).
