  "content": "This chunk defines a list of keyboard events and their corresponding actions within a `FlyCam` class, mapping keys like `'c'`, `'f'`, `'h'`, and others to various camera manipulation functions such as centering the view, fitting on a widget, moving to home position, toggling marker visibility, and more. These key bindings are essential for controlling camera behavior in a 3D scene.\n\n# [gjeon] moved all of the hotkeys to single place for easy remapping\n##         self.keyEvents = [\n##             ['c', self.centerCamIn, 0.5],\n##             ['f', self.fitOnWidget],                  # Note: This function doesn't work as intended\n##             ['h', self.homeCam],\n##             ['shift-v', self.toggleMarkerVis],\n##             ['m', self.moveToFit],                      # Note: This function doesn't work as intended; the object dissappears and screen flashes\n##             ['n', self.pickNextCOA],\n##             ['u', self.orbitUprightCam],\n##             ['shift-u', self.uprightCam],\n##             [repr(1), self.spawnMoveToView, 1],\n##             [repr(2), self.spawnMoveToView, 2],\n##             [repr(3), self.spawnMoveToView, 3],\n##             [repr(4), self.spawnMoveToView, 4],\n##             [repr(5), self.spawnMoveToView, 5],\n##             [repr(6), self.spawnMoveToView, 6],\n##             [repr(7), self.spawnMoveToView, 7],",
