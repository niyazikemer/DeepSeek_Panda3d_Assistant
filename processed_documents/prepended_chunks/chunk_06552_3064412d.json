These commands affect entire categories of sounds. Passing True or False in the last 2 functions will disable or enable the respective groups.\n\nbase.disableAllAudio()\nbase.enableAllAudio()\nbase.enableMusic(True)\nbase.enableSoundEffects(True)\n\nPositional audio is implemented through a wrapper of these objects and is covered in the next section, 3d-audio.",
