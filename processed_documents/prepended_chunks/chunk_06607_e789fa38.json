  "content": "The chunk provides an introduction to Panda's single-threaded render pipeline by defining the \"App\" phase, which includes user code and synchronous calculations. This explanation precedes a discussion on how enabling a multithreaded model can improve performance by separating App, Cull, and Draw phases into different threads.\n\nTo use this feature successfully, you will need to understand something about how it works. First, consider Panda's normal, single-threaded render pipeline. The time spent processing each frame can be subdivided into three separate phases, called \"App\", \"Cull\", and \"Draw\":\n\nIn Panda's nomenclature, \"App\" is any time spent in the application yourself, i.e. your program. This is your main loop, including any Python code (or C++ code) you write to control your particular game's logic. It also includes any Panda-based calculations that must be performed synchronously with this application code; for instance, the collision traversal is usually considered to be part of App.",
