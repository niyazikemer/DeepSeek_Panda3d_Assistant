Textures will be drawn in blue for mipmap level 0, yellow\nfor mipmap level 1, and red for all higher mipmap levels. Brighter\ncolors represent larger textures. gl-show-texture-usage-max-size int 1024 Specifies the texture size (along one side) of the largest texture\nexpected to be loaded. This controls the assignment of the texture color\nin gl-show-texture-usage mode; colors will be fully bright for textures\nof this size or larger. gl-support-clamp-to-border bool 1 Configure this true to enable the use of the clamp_to_border\nextension if the GL claims to support it, or false not to use it even if\nit appears to be available. (On some OpenGL drivers, enabling this mode\ncan force software rendering.) gl-support-fbo bool 1 Configure this false if your GL's implementation of\nEXT_framebuffer_object is broken. The system might still be able to\ncreate buffers using pbuffers or the like. gl-support-occlusion-query bool 1 Configure this true to enable the use of the occlusion_query",
