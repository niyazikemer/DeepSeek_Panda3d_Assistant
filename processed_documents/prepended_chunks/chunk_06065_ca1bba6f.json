  "content": "This section introduces Panda3D's built-in support for various input devices starting from version 1.10, including joysticks, gamepads, and steering wheels. It explains the classification of connected devices into categories such as unknown, virtual_ device, keyboard, mouse, touch, gamepad, flight_ stick, steering_ wheel, dance_ pad, hmd, and spatial_ mouse. This foundational information is presented before discussing specific functionalities like handling button events or axis values.\n\nJoystick Support\n\nAs of version 1.10, Panda3D gained built-in support for various input devices including but not limited to joysticks, gamepads and steering wheels.\n\nWe'll be starting with a little bit of theory to get you some knowledge of the underlying system to be able to understand how gamepad support works. The support for devices is given through evdev, the joystick api or xinput dependent on the OS you are using. Hence all devices that are recognized by your system will be available by the engine. Each connected device will be classified by one of the following device classes:\n\n# It is not known what type of device this is.\nunknown\n\n# This means that the device doesn't correspond to a physical\n# device, but rather to a dynamic source of input events.\nvirtual_device\n\n# A physical, alphabetical keyboard.\nkeyboard\nmouse\ntouch\n\n# A gamepad with action buttons, a D-pad, and thumbsticks.\ngamepad\n\nflight_stick\nsteering_wheel\ndance_pad\n\n# Head-mounted display.\nhmd",
