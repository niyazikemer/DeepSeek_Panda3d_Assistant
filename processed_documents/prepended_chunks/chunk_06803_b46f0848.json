The specific variables discussed\u2014max-lenses, max-occlusion-vertices, and max-resident-vertex-data\u2014are crucial for controlling memory usage and rendering efficiency. \n\nContext: This section discusses settings that optimize rendering performance by managing memory and preventing excessive resource usage through limits on lenses, occlusion testing subdivisions, and resident vertex data.\n\nAnswer: The chunk is situated within a section of the document dedicated to optimizing rendering performance in Panda3D, specifically addressing parameters that control memory usage, resource allocation for occlusion queries, and limiting the number of lenses to ensure efficient scene rendering.\n\nlatency. max-lenses int 100 Specifies an upper limit on the maximum number of lenses and the\nmaximum lens index number) that may be associated with a single\nLensNode. There is no technical reason for this limitation, but very\nlarge numbers are probably a mistake, so this can be used as a simple\nsanity check. Set it larger or smaller to suit your needs. max-occlusion-vertices int 3000 The maximum number of vertices that may be included in a PandaNode\nand its descendents in order to perform an occlusion query for it.\nSubgraphs whose total vertex count exceeds this number will be\nsubdivided further before performing an occlusion test--the hope is that\nwe can eventually get to a finer-grained answer. GeomNodes and Geoms\nwill not be subdivided, regardless of this limit. max-resident-vertex-data int -1 Specifies the maximum number of bytes of all vertex data that is\nallowed to remain resident in system RAM at one time.
