  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a Python class implementation for handling phased collision detection in 3D environments (likely within the Panda3D framework). The specific methods `__getExitEvent` and `__enableCollisions` are critical components for managing phase-based collision zones, where each phase is represented by a spherical collider. These methods handle event generation and collision activation/deactivation based on the current phase state, ensuring proper event handling across different phases without flickering or overlap issues.\n\ndef __getExitEvent(self, phaseName):\n        return '%sPhaseNode%s-%d' % (self.exitPrefix, phaseName, self.__id)\n\n    def __enableCollisions(self, phase):\n        \"\"\"\n        Turns on collisions for the spheres bounding this\n        phase zone by unstashing their geometry.
