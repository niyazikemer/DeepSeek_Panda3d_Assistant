  "content": "The chunk provides an introductory example demonstrating the application of a texture with alpha cutouts to a smiley model, illustrating how different texture modes affect transparency and color modulation in Panda3D.\n\nThe Basics\n\nLet's go back to the example of applying a texture to the smiley model. In this case, we'll create a new TextureStage to apply the following texture image:\n\nTo this scene:\n\nNote that the circular white part of the sample image is actually not white at all, but an alpha cutout (you are seeing through the image to the white page background). We have rendered smiley.egg against a colored background so you can see the effects of alpha in the various modes below; in some of them, the alpha is propagated through to the final color, so smiley is transparent in those parts of the image, but in other modes, the alpha is used for a different purpose, and smiley is not transparent there.\n\nNote also that, for the purposes of illustration, we have only applied the sample texture image to a portion of the smiley model, rather than to the whole model. (This was done by transforming the texture coordinates of this texture stage, which is covered in a later topic <texture-transforms>.)",
