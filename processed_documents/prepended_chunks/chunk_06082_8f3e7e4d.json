  "content": "The provided chunk describes how to create a stereo off-screen buffer using Panda3D 1.9.0 and above without requiring special hardware, as well as how to access individual left and right eye views within a StereoDisplayRegion, which is essential for configuring and working with stereo output in graphics applications.\n\n(4) As of Panda3D 1.9.0, you may create a stereo off-screen buffer without special hardware support, assuming the card supports using multiple render targets (most modern cards do), by setting the stereo flag in the .FrameBufferProperties object. Panda3D will automatically designate one of the draw buffers to contain the stereo view for the other eye. When binding a texture to the color attachment for render-to-texture, Panda3D will automatically initialize it as a multiview texture <multiview-textures> containing both left and right views. This is only supported in OpenGL as of writing.\n\nUsing a StereoDisplayRegion\n\nA StereoDisplayRegion actually consists of two ordinary DisplayRegions, created automatically. If you need to, you can access them individually with sdr.get_left_eye() <.StereoDisplayRegion.get_left_eye> or sdr.get_right_eye() <.StereoDisplayRegion.get_right_eye>.",
