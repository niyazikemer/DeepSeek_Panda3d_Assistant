  "content": "The `OnscreenGeom` class in the module combines `DirectObject` for event handling and `NodePath` for scene graph operations. Its `__init__` method sets up 2D geometry placement with optional parameters like position (`pos`), rotation (`hpr`), scale, color, parent node, and sort order, as documented.\n\nclass OnscreenGeom(DirectObject, NodePath):\n    def __init__(self, geom = None,\n                 pos = None,\n                 hpr = None,\n                 scale = None,\n                 color = None,\n                 parent = None,\n                 sort = 0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Make a geom node from string or a node path,\n        put it into the 2d sg and set it up with all the indicated parameters.\n\n        The parameters are as follows:\n\n          geom: the actual geometry to display or a file name.\n                This may be omitted and specified later via setGeom()\n                if you don't have it available.\n\n          pos: the x, y, z position of the geometry on the screen.\n               This maybe a 3-tuple of floats or a vector.\n               y should be zero\n\n          hpr: the h, p, r of the geometry on the screen.\n               This maybe a 3-tuple of floats or a vector.",
