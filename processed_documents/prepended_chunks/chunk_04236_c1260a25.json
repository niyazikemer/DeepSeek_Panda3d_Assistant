  "content": "This chunk is part of a method within a class responsible for managing a visual display system, specifically handling card layouts and rendering in a graphical application. The code calculates an aspect ratio to maintain consistent scaling across windows and sets a border size around displayed cards to ensure proper spacing.\n\n**Context:**\nThe code determines the aspect ratio from window dimensions to ensure uniform scaling and defines a 4-pixel border for card separation, enhancing visual layout management.\n\n# Choose an aspect ratio for the cards.  All card size\n        # calculations are done in pixel-units, using integers,\n        # in order to ensure that everything ends up neatly on\n        # a pixel boundary.\n\n        aspectx = wins[0].getXSize()\n        aspecty = wins[0].getYSize()\n        for win in wins:\n            if win.getXSize() * aspecty != win.getYSize() * aspectx:\n                aspectx = 1\n                aspecty = 1\n\n        # Choose a card size.  If the user didn't specify a size,\n        # use a heuristic, otherwise, just follow orders.  The\n        # heuristic uses an initial card size of 42.66666667% of\n        # the screen vertically, which comes to 256 pixels on\n        # an 800x600 display.  Then, it double checks that the\n        # readout will fit on the screen, and if not, it shrinks it.\n\n        bordersize = 4.0",
