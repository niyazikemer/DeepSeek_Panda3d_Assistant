Options: Create new Effect, Select Particle Effect, Place Particle Effect, Toggle Effect Vis, Enable/Disable.\n\nSelect effect to configure or create new effect.\n\nSelect particles object to configure or add new particles object to current effect.\n\nSystem:\n\nMax number of simultaneous particles. More amount of particles won't exist at the same time.\n\nSeconds between particle births. No new particles will be generated during this period.\n\nNumber of particles created at each birth.\n\nVariation in litter size, so exactly the same amount of particles won't be generated at each birth as set in the \"Litter Size\".\n\nAge in seconds at which the system (vs. Particles) should die. Default is 0, which means the particle generator won't die.\n\nWhether or not velocities are absolute.",
