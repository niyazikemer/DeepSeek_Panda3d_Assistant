  "content": "The provided code chunk introduces two key components: `ToneMap`, an enumeration defining tone mapping operators (ACES and PBR_NEUTRAL) used in High Dynamic Range (HDR) rendering configuration; and `FilterConfig`, a class that likely encapsulates various rendering filter configurations such as bloom, cartoon ink, view glow, and other post-processing effects. These components are integral to configuring advanced visual effects and rendering pipelines within the document's overall rendering system.\n\nclass ToneMap:\n    ACES = object()\n    PBR_NEUTRAL = object()\n\n\nclass FilterConfig:\n    pass",
