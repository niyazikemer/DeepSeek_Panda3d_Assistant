  "content": "The chunk explains an example implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Panda3D that manages compass direction transitions based on input commands like \"left\" or \"straight\". It focuses on defining filter functions to handle state transitions.\n\nIn this example, we have encoded a simple FSM that determines which compass direction a character will be facing after either turning left or continuing straight. The input will be either \"left\" or \"straight\", and the result is a transition to a new state that represents the new compass direction, based on the previous compass direction. If we request \"left\" from state North, the FSM transitions to state West. On the other hand, if we request \"left\" from state South, the FSM transitions to state East. If we request \"straight\" from any state, the FSM should remain in its current state.\n\nTo implement this in Panda3D, we define a number of filter functions, one for each state. The purpose of this function is to decide what state to transition to next, if any, on receipt of a particular input.",
