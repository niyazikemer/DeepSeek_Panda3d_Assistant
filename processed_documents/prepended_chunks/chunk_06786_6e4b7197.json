  "content": "The document contains various Panda configuration variables. The chunk discusses settings related to GLSL shader preprocessing and OpenGL function access, specifically `glsl- preprocess`, `glx-get-os- address`, and `glx-get-proc- address`.\n\nPanda will follow when glsl-preprocess is enabled. This is used to\nprevent infinite recursion when two shader files include each\nother. glsl-preprocess bool 1 If this is enabled, Panda looks for lines starting with #pragma\ninclude when loading a GLSL shader and processes it appropriately. This\ncan be useful if you have code that is shared between multiple shaders.\nSet this to false if you have no need for this feature or if you do your\nown preprocessing of GLSL shaders. glx-get-os-address bool 1 Set this to true to allow Panda to query the OpenGL library directly\nusing standard operating system calls to locate addresses of extension\nfunctions. This will be done only if glxGetProcAddress() cannot be used\nfor some reason. glx-get-proc-address bool 1 Set this to true to allow the use of glxGetProcAddress(), if it is\navailable, to query the OpenGL extension functions. This is the standard",
