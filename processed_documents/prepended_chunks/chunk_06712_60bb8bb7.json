  "content": "The chunk discusses boolean flags related to rendering optimization and threading in Panda, including whether geometry should be paged asynchronously or synchronously, allowing flattening of live scene graph nodes, and enabling non-pipelining threads for debugging purposes. These settings are part of a broader document detailing configuration variables for system interactions, window properties, and performance optimizations in the Panda framework.\n\nsoon as they can be read from disk, which may be several frames in the\nfuture. When this is false, geometry is always paged in immediately when\nneeded, holding up the frame render if necessary. allow-live-flatten bool 1 Set this true to allow the use of flatten_strong() or any variant on\na node that is attached to a live scene graph node, or false to disallow\nthis. Flattening a live scene graph node can cause problems when\nthreading is enabled. This variable only has an effect when Panda is not\ncompiled for a release build. allow-nonpipeline-threads bool 0 This variable should only be set true for debugging or development\npurposes. When true, the threading-model variable may specify a threaded\npipeline mode, even if pipelining is not compiled in. This will\ncertainly result in erroneous behavior, and quite likely will cause a\ncrash. Do not set this unless you know what you are doing. allow-portal-cull bool 0 Set this true to enable portal clipping. This will enable the",
