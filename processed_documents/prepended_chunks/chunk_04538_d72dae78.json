  "content": "The chunk defines two utility methods within a Python class responsible for scheduling periodic leak checks and pruning operations in an event-driven system. These methods allow retrieving paths to containers based on type or name by creating and submitting relevant jobs through the job manager.\n\nContext: The code is part of a class managing asynchronous tasks, where `getPathsToContainers` and `getPathsToContainersNamed` provide functionality to locate specific objects within the application's object graph.\n\nself._scheduleNextLeakCheck()\n        self._scheduleNextPruning()\n\n        while True:\n            yield Job.Sleep\n\n    def getPathsToContainers(self, name, ot, doneCallback=None):\n        j =  FPTObjsOfType(name, self, ot, doneCallback)\n        jobMgr.add(j)\n        return j\n\n    def getPathsToContainersNamed(self, name, on, doneCallback=None):\n        j =  FPTObjsNamed(name, self, on, doneCallback)\n        jobMgr.add(j)\n        return j",
