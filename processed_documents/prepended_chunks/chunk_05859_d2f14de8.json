  "content": "The chunk explains how to modify the vertex data's format by adding a new column or altering an existing one in Panda3D, emphasizing the importance of setting the new format before creating any GeomVertexWriter or GeomVertexReader instances.\n\nSuccinct Context: The process of adding a new column or modifying an existing column's format involves creating a new geomvertexformat and applying it to the GeomVertexData before initializing readers or writers.\n\nIf you want to add a new column to a GeomVertexData, or modify the format of an existing column, you will have to create a new geomvertexformat that includes the new column (see defining-your-own-geomvertexformat), and then change the format on the GeomVertexData via vdata.set_format(format) <.GeomVertexData.set_format>. This call will internally adjust all of the data to match the new format. (Because of this internal adjustment, it is important to do this before you create the first GeomVertexWriter or GeomVertexReader.)",
