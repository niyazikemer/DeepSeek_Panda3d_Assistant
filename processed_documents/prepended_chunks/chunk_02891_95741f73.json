  "content": "The provided chunk from the MetaInterval class deals with managing interval-based animations or processes, specifically handling play rate adjustments and interval addition. The setPlayRate method allows dynamic speed changes for ongoing intervals without restarting them, enhancing real-time control. Additionally, it manages adding single intervals directly but raises an error when encountering multiple intervals, indicating its design for structured, single-interval operations within an animation framework.\n\n**Context:**\nThe code chunk is part of a system managing interval-based animations or processes.
