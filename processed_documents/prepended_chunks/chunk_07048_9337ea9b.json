  "content": "The chunk provides guidance on setting up a custom `MouseWatcher` for DirectGui interaction when creating a 2-D scene graph in Panda3D, particularly when working with a window other than the default `base.win`.\n\nIf this is for a different window than base.win, you will probably need to also create your own MouseWatcher, other than base.mouseWatcherNode, to manage the mouse associated with your new window. See elsewhere for more information about this.",
