  "content": "This chunk provides an overview of the process of compiling a Panda3D application into a self-contained executable using the `build_apps` command. It explains how this tool fetches necessary dependencies as wheels, compiles bytecode, bundles assets, and handles platform-specific requirements to create distributable executables for different operating systems.\n\nBuilding Binaries\n\nOverview\n\nPanda3D adds a build_apps command to setuptools that can compile a Panda3D application into a self-contained executable for all supported operating systems. This command uses pip to fetch the dependencies, downloaded in the form of .whl files (\"wheels\"), then compiles all of the bytecode into an executable file and bundles it with the assets, any DLLs and other files that may be required by the application or its dependencies.\n\nThe tool also needs to fetch a wheel for Panda3D itself. It needs to do this because the already-installed version will not work on other platforms, and furthermore it is built with debugging tools enabled and not optimized for distribution.",
