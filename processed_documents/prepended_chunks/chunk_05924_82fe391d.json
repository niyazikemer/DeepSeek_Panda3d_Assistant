  "content": "The chunk is part of a detailed explanation of texture mapping in 3D modeling, focusing on how (u, v) texture coordinates determine the application of a texture map to a model. It provides an example using the sample smiley.egg model to illustrate how the u and v coordinates are defined and how they cause the texture image to be wrapped around the sphere. This explanation emphasizes that the (u, v) range for a texture image is always 0 to 1, regardless of the texture's size.\n\nThe chunk explains how (u, v) texture coordinates determine the application of a texture map onto a 3D model by mapping vertices to specific points in the texture space. The example with the smiley.egg model demonstrates this process and highlights that the (u, v) range remains consistent irrespective of the texture's actual dimensions.\n\nIt is the (u, v) texture coordinates that you assign to the vertices that determine how the texture map will be applied to your model. When each triangle of your model is drawn, it is drawn with the colors from your texture map that fall within the same triangle of vertices in (u, v) texture map space. For instance, the sample smiley.egg model that ships with Panda has its vertices defined such that the u coordinate increases from 0 to 1 around its diameter, and the v coordinate increases from 0 at the bottom to 1 at the top. This causes the texture image to be wrapped horizontally around the sphere:\n\nNote that the (u, v) range for a texture image is always the same, 0 to 1, regardless of the size of the texture.",
