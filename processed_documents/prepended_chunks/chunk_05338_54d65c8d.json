  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of the `StagedObject` class, specifically within the `handleOffStage` method. The chunk includes a reminder to call down to the parent implementation when overriding this method and sets the object's state to OFF. Additionally, it defines two methods, `isOnStage` and `isOffStage`, which check whether the object is currently on stage or off stage by comparing the internal state variable against the defined constants.\n\nDon't forget to call down to this one, though.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.__state = StagedObject.OFF\n\n    def isOnStage(self):\n        return self.__state == StagedObject.ON\n\n    def isOffStage(self):\n        return self.__state == StagedObject.OFF",
