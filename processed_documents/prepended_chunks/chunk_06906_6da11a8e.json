  "content": "The document introduces the concept of clients in a distributed network system, detailing their role in connecting users to the server, managing input and output, while deferring complex game logic to the AI server. Further chapters will explore key client-side implementations.\n\nClients\n\nThis is the part that the end-users will see and have running on their own machines. These applications are primarily there to connect to the server, gather user input and handle the audiovisual output. They should not have to handle much of the game logic as that\u2019s handled by the AI server.\n\nThe important parts which have to be implemented in client applications to work with the distributed network will be shown in the next chapters.",
