  "content": "The sample program demonstrates different mouse interaction modes in Panda3D, explaining how each mode affects cursor behavior within the window, particularly important for maintaining smooth gameplay in first-person applications.\n\nSample Programs: Mouse Modes\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nExplanation\n\nThis sample program shows usage of different mouse modes, which control how the mouse cursor interacts with a Panda3D window.\n\nFor the purposes of first-person games with \"mouselook,\" it's important to use a mode other than the default (\"absolute\"), because in that mode, the mouse cursor may easily leave the window, and your game will stop receiving mouse events.\n\nTo maintain a consistent stream of pointer events no matter how much the user moves the mouse, the \"relative\" mode and \"confined\" mode (new in 1.9.1) will keep the pointer inside the window.",
