  "content": "The chunk introduces a `copy_with_dependencies` method intended for the `bdist_apps` command in a setuptools script. This method is designed to handle file copying along with dependency resolution, supporting both regular files and those extracted from wheels. It should be added as an instance method within the `bdist_apps` class to facilitate handling file dependencies during the package build process.\n\nHere's how the code would look after adding the method:\n\n```python\nclass bdist_apps(BuildAppsCommand):\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    def copy_with_dependencies(self, source_path, target_path, search_path):\n        \"\"\"Copies source_path to target_path. It also scans source_path for any dependencies,\n        which are located along the given search_path and copied to the same directory as\n        target_path.\"\"\"\n        # Make the directory if it does not yet exist.\n        target_dir = os.path.dirname(target_path)\n        if not os.path.isdir(target_dir):\n            os.makedirs(target_dir)\n\n        # Copy the file, and open it for analysis.\n        if '.whl' in source_path:\n            # This was found in a wheel, extract it\n            whl, wf = source_path.split('.whl' + os.path.sep)\n            whl += '.whl'\n            whlfile = self._get_zip_file(whl)\n            data = whlfile.read(wf.replace(os.path.sep, '/'))\n            with open(target_path, 'wb') as f:\n                f.write(data)\n        else:\n            # Regular file, copy it\n            shutil.copyfile(source_path, target_path)\n\n    # ... rest of the existing code ...\n```\n\n**Succinct Context:**\nThe chunk is a method added to the `bdist_apps` command class, enhancing its functionality by enabling the copying of files along with their dependencies, whether from regular files or wheels. This supports proper resource handling during package builds.\n\n# Make the directory if it does not yet exist.\n        target_dir = os.path.dirname(target_path)\n        if not os.path.isdir(target_dir):\n            os.makedirs(target_dir)\n\n        # Copy the file, and open it for analysis.\n        if '.whl' in source_path:\n            # This was found in a wheel, extract it\n            whl, wf = source_path.split('.whl' + os.path.sep)\n            whl += '.whl'\n            whlfile = self._get_zip_file(whl)\n            data = whlfile.read(wf.replace(os.path.sep, '/'))\n            with open(target_path, 'wb') as f:\n                f.write(data)\n        else:\n            # Regular file, copy it\n            shutil.copyfile(source_path, target_path)\n\n    def copy_with_dependencies(self, source_path, target_path, search_path):\n        \"\"\" Copies source_path to target_path.  It also scans source_path for\n        any dependencies, which are located along the given search_path and\n        copied to the same directory as target_path.",
