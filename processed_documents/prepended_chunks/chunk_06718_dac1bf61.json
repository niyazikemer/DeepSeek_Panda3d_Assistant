  "content": "The chunk discusses performance optimization, memory management, and rendering settings for Panda3D, including explicitly clearing transformation caches to prevent memory leaks, controlling frame flipping behavior for responsiveness or parallelism, garbage logging for debugging, CPU affinity for single-core optimization, and specifying auxiliary display libraries for platform-specific rendering.\n\nyou must explicitly call TransformState.clear_cache() from time to time\nto prevent gradual memory bloat. auto-flip bool 0 This indicates the initial setting of the auto-flip flag. Set it\ntrue to cause render_frame() to flip all the windows before it returns\n(in single-threaded mode only), or false to wait until an explicit call\nto flip_frame() or the next render_frame(). Setting it true gets more\nimmediate response time, while setting it false can get a better frame\nrate as more is achieved in parallel with the graphics card. auto-garbage-logging bool 0 DConfig auto-single-cpu-affinity bool 0 DConfig aux-display list Names each of the graphics display libraries that are available on a\nparticular platform. This variable may be repeated several times. These\nlibraries will be tried one at a time if the library specified by",
