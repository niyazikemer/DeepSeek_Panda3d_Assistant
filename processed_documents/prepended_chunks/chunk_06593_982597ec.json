  "content": "The chunk discusses the core interface classes for manipulating vertex data in a `geomvertexdata` object, specifically focusing on their initialization and row-wise operations to read or write vertex attributes efficiently.\n\nMore about GeomVertexReader, GeomVertexWriter, and GeomVertexRewriter\n\nThe classes GeomVertexReader and GeomVertexWriter together represent the core interface for reading and writing the numeric data stored within a geomvertexdata object.\n\nThese two classes work similarly. Both are designed to get a temporary pointer to the data for a particular column when they are constructed, and they increment that pointer as you walk through the vertices. Initially, they start at row number 0 (the first vertex in the table), and after each setData/getData operation, they automatically increment to the next row (the next vertex).\n\nYou construct a GeomVertexReader or GeomVertexWriter with a pointer to the geomvertexdata object you are operating on, and the name of the column you wish to process, e.g.:\n\ncolor = GeomVertexReader(vdata, 'color')",
