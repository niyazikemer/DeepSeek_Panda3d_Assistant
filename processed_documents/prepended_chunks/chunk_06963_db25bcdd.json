  "content": "The chunk explains the 'Advanced' version of the Glow Filter sample program, detailing how custom Cg shaders are used to create a glow effect by leveraging the alpha channel as a glow map and rendering the scene into multiple offscreen buffers for postprocessing.\n\nExplanation of the 'Advanced' Version\n\nThe advanced version shows how to use Cg shaders to implement a \"glow\" postprocessing filter. The demo will only work on video cards that support shaders.\n\nIf you examine the texture for this model in photoshop, you'll see that it has an alpha channel. I'm not using the alpha channel to represent transparency. Instead, the alpha channel is a \"glow map.\" Where the alpha is 1, the model glows, in places where the alpha is zero, it does not glow.\n\nThe scene is rendered to the main window in the normal way. It is also rendered to an offscreen buffer using a special shader that pays attention to the glow map (in the alpha channel). Wherever the glow map is 1, it renders the model's normal color. Wherever the glow map is 0, it renders black. This offscreen buffer is called the \"glow buffer\".",
