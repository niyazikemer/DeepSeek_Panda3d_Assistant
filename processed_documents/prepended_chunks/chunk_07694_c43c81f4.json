  "content": "This chunk is situated in the C++ section of the document, specifically under the topic of controlling animations after binding them using AnimControlCollection. It provides important notes about adding more animations post-auto_bind and storing animations with models in Panda3D's C++ implementation.\n\nIf you add more animations to some node after calling: auto_bind(...) they will not be controllable until auto_bind(...) is called again with proper arguments.\n\nNote that it is possible to store the animations and the model in the same file.",
