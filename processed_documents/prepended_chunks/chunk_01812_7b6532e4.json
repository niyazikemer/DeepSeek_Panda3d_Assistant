  "content": "The `orbitMode` method is part of a class that manages different interaction modes for 3D object manipulation, such as free movement, orbiting, or object-relative positioning. It sets the current mode to 'Orbit Mode', enabling orbital movement around a reference point using the `orbitFly` method. This chunk represents one of several state management functions in the class, allowing users to switch between different interaction styles for controlling 3D objects.\n\ndef orbitMode(self):\n        self.setMode(self.orbitFly, 'Orbit Mode')",
