  "content": "The document explains how Bullet simulates soft body deformation in real-time by modeling soft bodies as compound objects made of nodes and links. The provided chunk describes the third type of soft body: a three-dimensional mesh composed of tetrahedrons, emphasizing that a surface mesh alone is insufficient and that the entire volume must be represented. It also mentions that all soft body types use the same simulation class, notes the lack of low-level interfaces in Panda3D for creating or modifying soft body nodes, and provides a warning about the early stage support for Bullet soft bodies within Panda3D.\n\nFinally a three dimensional mesh made up from tetrahedrons. For this kind of soft body a surface mesh is not enough. The whole volume of the body has to be composed from small tetrahedrons.\n\nAll three kinds of soft bodies are simulated using the same class, .BulletSoftBodyNode. It's just a matter of how the links between the nodes are created.\n\nPanda3D currently provides no low-level interface for creating and modifying the soft body nodes and links directly. Soft bodies are created using factory methods which simplify the process for you.\n\nWarning: Bullet soft body support within Panda3D is at an early stage. Use it with care. It is also highly recommended to keep the original Bullet documentation close at hand, in order to find the right values e. g. for cluster or collision configuration.",
