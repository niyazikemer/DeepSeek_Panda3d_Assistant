  "content": "The given chunk discusses transitioning between Walk and Swim states in an FSM implementation using Panda3D. It demonstrates requesting a state change via `myfsm.request('Swim')` and introduces more complex state transitions, such as handling transition animations (Walk2Swim and Swim2Walk) and additional states like Drowning. This section builds on the initial two-state example to illustrate how FSMs can manage increasingly intricate game logic.\n\nNow to switch from Walk state to Swim state, you would just need to request a transition, like this:\n\nmyfsm.request('Swim')\n\nThis FSM is a very simple example. Soon you will find the need for more than two states. For instance, you might want to play a transition animation while the avatar is moving from Walk state to Swim state and back again, and these can be encoded as separate states. There might be a \"drowning\" animation if the avatar stays too long underwater, which again might be another state. Graphically, this now looks like this:\n\ntransitions\n\nrankdir=LR node [style=rounded, shape=box]\n\nWalk -> Walk2Swim; Walk2Swim -> Swim; Swim -> Swim2Walk; Swim2Walk -> Walk; Swim -> Drowning;\n\n{ rank=same; Walk2Swim; Swim2Walk; }",
