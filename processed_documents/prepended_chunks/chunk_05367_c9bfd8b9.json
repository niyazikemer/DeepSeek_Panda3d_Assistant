  "content": "The document describes an `Avatar` class with methods for managing avatar movement, including activation of smoothing and prediction features to ensure smooth motion rendering based on received position reports. The specific chunk explains the implications of disabling smoothing and how prediction affects avatar motion (lagging vs. extrapolation).\n\nIf smoothing is off, no kind of smoothing will be performed,\n        regardless of the setting of prediction.\n\n        This is not necessarily predictive smoothing; if predictive\n        smoothing is off, avatars will be lagged by a certain factor\n        to achieve smooth motion.  Otherwise, if predictive smoothing\n        is on, avatars will be drawn as nearly as possible in their\n        current position, by extrapolating from old position reports.",
