  "content": "This chunk is situated within a discussion about the `forceTransition()` method in Python's FSM implementation. The context explains that while `forceTransition()` can be useful for bypassing normal state transition checks (e.g., for emergency cleanup), overusing it may indicate that the filter functions or default transitions are not properly allowing legitimate state changes, suggesting potential issues with their design.\n\nyou find yourself making lots of calls to forceTransition(), it may be that your filter functions (or your defaultTransitions) are poorly written and are disallowing what should be legitimate state transitions.",
