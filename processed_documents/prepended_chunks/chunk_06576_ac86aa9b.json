  "content": "The document discusses creating complex character models using multi-part actors in Panda3D, where separate model pieces (e.g., legs, torso) are connected via shared bones/joints. The chunk situates within a section explaining how to animate these multi-part actors, emphasizing that each part's animations must be controlled individually by specifying the part name when calling `play()` or accessing AnimControl.\n\nAnimation\n\nYou can animate the parts as normal animations, but you need to supply the partname, like this:\n\nmyactor.play('Animation Name', 'Part Name')\n\nIf you want to use AnimControl, as explained in this section <actor-animations>, you must supply the part name as second parameter in ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.getAnimControl():\n\n# you can see you just need to call\n# actor.getAnimControl('Animation Name', 'Part Name')\n# to get access to the AnimControl of that part.",
