  "content": "This chunk of code calculates the movement speeds (forward/reverse, slide, and rotation) for an avatar based on keyboard inputs within the `handleAvatarControls` method. It determines how fast the avatar moves forward/backward (`self.speed`), slides left/right (`self.slideSpeed`), and rotates in place (`self.rotationSpeed`) based on user input commands. This code is situated within a larger system that handles avatar physics, collisions, and task management for real-time game or simulation controls.\n\n# Determine what the speeds are based on the buttons:\n        self.speed=(forward and self.avatarControlForwardSpeed or\n                    reverse and -self.avatarControlReverseSpeed)\n        # Slide speed is a scaled down version of forward speed\n        # Note: you can multiply a factor in here if you want slide to\n        # be slower than normal walk/run.
