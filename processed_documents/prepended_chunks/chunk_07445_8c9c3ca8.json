  "content": "The document provides a detailed guide on using the Panda3D PNMImage class for image manipulation. The section you've highlighted is situated within a discussion of methods related to grayscale conversion, brightness calculations, and other image processing functions. It precedes a section about storing textures into images and loading modified images back into textures, offering essential information for developers working with image data in Panda3D applications.\n\nYou can also make an image grayscale using ~.PNMImage.make_grayscale(). To set or get a grayscale value, you can use ~.PNMImage.get_gray() and ~.PNMImage.set_gray(). (Using these functions on a color image will just affect the value in the blue channel.) If you want to get the grayscale value of a pixel regardless of whether the image is a grayscale or a color image, you can use get_bright(x, y) <.PNMImage.get_bright>, which works equally well on color or on grayscale images. If you want to weight the colors use get_bright(x, y, r, g, b) <.PNMImage.get_bright>, where r, g, b are the weights for the respective channels.\n\nThere are several other useful functions in the class, which are described on the ~panda3d.core.PNMImage page in the API Reference.\n\nStoring a Texture into an Image",
