  "content": "The chunk is situated within a section discussing Finite State Machine (FSM) functionality in Python, specifically exploring the methods `request()` and `demand()` used to manage state transitions.\n\nAdvanced FSM Tidbits\n\npython\n\nrequest vs. demand\n\nAs stated previously, you normally request an FSM to change its state by calling either fsm.request('NewState', arg1, arg2, ...), or fsm.request('inputString', arg1, arg2, ...), where arg1, arg2, ... represent optional arguments to the destination state's enter function (or to the filter function). The call to request() will either succeed or fail, according to what the filter function for the current state does. If it succeeds, it will return the tuple ('NewState', arg1, arg2), indicating the new state it has transitioned to. If it fails, it will simply return None (unless the filter function was written to throw an exception on failure).",
