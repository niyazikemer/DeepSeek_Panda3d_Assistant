  "content": "The chunk discusses why 3D textures are rarely used in games due to their difficulty for artists to hand-paint, suggesting procedural generation as a practical alternative.\n\nBut probably the bigger reason that 3-D textures are rarely used in games is that the texture images in games are typically hand-painted, and it is difficult for an artist to paint a 3-D texture. It is usually much easier just to paint the surface of an object.\n\nSo when 3-D textures are used at all, they are often generated procedurally. One classic example of a procedural 3-D texture is wood grain; it is fairly easy to define a convincing woodgrain texture procedurally. For instance, click here <woodgrain-example> to view a Panda3D program that generates a woodgrain texture and stores it as a series of files named woodgrain_0.png, woodgrain_1.png, and so on. The following code applies this woodgrain texture to the teapot, to make a teapot that looks like it was carved from a single block of wood:",
