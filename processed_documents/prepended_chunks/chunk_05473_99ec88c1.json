  "content": "The `ParentMgr` class is designed to manage parent-child relationships between distributed objects in a networked environment, allowing avatars and other entities to be positioned relative to specific nodes using unique tokens.\n\nclass ParentMgr:\n    # This is now used on the AI as well.\n    \"\"\"ParentMgr holds a table of nodes that avatars may be parented to\n    in a distributed manner. All clients within a particular zone maintain\n    identical tables of these nodes, and the nodes are referenced by 'tokens'\n    which the clients can pass to each other to communicate distributed\n    reparenting information.\n\n    The functionality of ParentMgr used to be implemented with a simple\n    token->node dictionary. As distributed 'parent' objects were manifested,\n    they would add themselves to the dictionary. Problems occured when\n    distributed avatars were manifested before the objects to which they\n    were parented to.",
