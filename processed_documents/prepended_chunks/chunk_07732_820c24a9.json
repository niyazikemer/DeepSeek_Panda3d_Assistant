  "content": "The document describes different particle renderers used in Panda3D to add particles to the visible scene graph. The chunk focuses on the `GeomParticleRenderer`, which is one of several renderer types available. This renderer allows developers to create full 3D objects by using a geometry node, providing more complex and customizable particle effects compared to simpler renderers like `PointParticleRenderer` or `SpriteParticleRenderer`.\n\nGeomParticleRenderer\n\nRenders particles as full 3D objects. This requires a geometry node.\n\nVariable Definition Values geomNode A geometry scene graph node",
