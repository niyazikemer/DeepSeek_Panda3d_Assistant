  "content": "The chunk discusses ensuring proper vertex index ranges when adding geometry primitives, a critical step after creating GeomVertexData and GeomPrimitives during the process of integrating custom geometry into a scene graph for rendering.\n\nIt is important that the range of vertex index numbers used by your GeomPrimitives is consistent with the number of vertices in your GeomVertexData (for instance, if you have 100 vertices in your GeomVertexData, your GeomPrimitives must only reference vertices numbered 0 through 99). If this is not the case, you will get an exception when you call addPrimitive().",
