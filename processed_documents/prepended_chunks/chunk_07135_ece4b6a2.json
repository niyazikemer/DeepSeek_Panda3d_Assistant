  "content": "The document discusses various aspects of texture compression in Panda3D, including runtime compression, pre-compressed formats (TXO and DDS), and the texture cache. The chunk explains that while image file formats like JPEG reduce file size on disk, they do not affect memory usage once loaded into the graphics card, leading to a discussion of in-memory compression solutions such as block compression, runtime compression options, and pre-compressed texture formats.\n\nTexture Compression\n\nYou may be familiar with image file formats like JPEG, which can compress image data dramatically and make image files much smaller than they would be otherwise, in return for sacrificing a tiny bit of the original image quality.\n\nJPEG compression only applies to the image size on disk, however. Once you load a texture image into memory, whether it came from a JPEG, PNG, or TGA file, it always takes up the same amount of texture memory on your graphics card (based on the size of the texture).",
