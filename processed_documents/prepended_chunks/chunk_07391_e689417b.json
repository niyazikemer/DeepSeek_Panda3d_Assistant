  "content": "The chunk provides an introduction to the Cartoon Shader sample program, explaining its purpose and setup while mentioning Panda3D installation and sample program locations for Windows and Linux users.\n\nSample Programs: Cartoon Shader\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nThis tutorial will show how to make a cartoon shader. It requires three separate shaders. On video cards that do not support shaders, the results will not be interesting.\n\nEvery frame, the scene is rendered into the main window using a \"lighting shader.\" The lighting shader calculates lighting pretty much the same way OpenGL always does, but it adds a threshold function, so that the line between light and dark is a clear, discrete line.",
