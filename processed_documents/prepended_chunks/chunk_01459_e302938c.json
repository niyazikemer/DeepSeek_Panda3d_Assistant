  "content": "The chunk represents the `__init__` method of the `OnscreenText` class in Python. This method is responsible for initializing a text node with various customizable properties such as position, styling, colors (foreground and background), shadow effects, frames, alignment, word wrap settings, font selection, and parent node assignment. It sets up the initial state of the text display within a 2D scene graph, enabling developers to create visually customized on-screen text elements for applications like games or graphical interfaces.\n\nclass OnscreenText(NodePath):\n\n    def __init__(self, text = '',\n                 style = Plain,\n                 pos = (0, 0),\n                 roll = 0,\n                 scale = None,\n                 fg = None,\n                 bg = None,\n                 shadow = None,\n                 shadowOffset = (0.04, 0.04),\n                 frame = None,\n                 align = None,\n                 wordwrap = None,\n                 drawOrder = None,\n                 decal = 0,\n                 font = None,\n                 parent = None,\n                 sort = 0,\n                 mayChange = True,\n                 direction = None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Make a text node from string, put it into the 2d sg and set it\n        up with all the indicated parameters.\n\n        Parameters:\n\n          text: the actual text to display.
