  "content": "The chunk should be situated in the section explaining stereo lens parameters, specifically following the discussion on interocular and convergence distances, to provide relevant context about a correction made in Panda3D 1.9.0.\n\n**Context:**\nIn discussing the stereo lens setup, after explaining the interocular distance (a) and convergence distance (b), as well as their effects on object placement relative to the screen plane, it's important to note any historical issues with how these parameters were calculated in earlier versions of Panda3D. This helps users understand potential legacy behavior adjustments they might need.\n\n**Answer:**\nThis chunk is situated within the section discussing stereo lens parameters and convergence distance in Panda3D, specifically noting a correction made in version 1.9.0 regarding the calculation of stereo convergence.\n\nNote\n\nPrior to Panda3D 1.9.0, the convergence was being calculated incorrectly. It has since been corrected. To restore the legacy behavior you can set the stereo-lens-old-convergence variable to true.",
