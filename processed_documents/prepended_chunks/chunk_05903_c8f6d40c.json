  "content": "The chunk explains how to set the film size of a lens, affecting its aspect ratio and relation to other properties. Setting only the width adjusts the height automatically, while specifying both changes the aspect ratio. This ties into understanding lens properties in software like Panda3D.\n\n**Context:**\nThis section discusses how to adjust the film size of a lens, which impacts the aspect ratio and interrelates with other properties such as focal length. By setting either just the width or both dimensions, you control whether the height is automatically adjusted or the aspect ratio is altered accordingly.\n\nYou can specify the film size with lens.set_film_size(width) <.Lens.set_film_size> or lens.set_film_size(width, height) <.Lens.set_film_size>. Like field of view, the film size has two components, a horizontal film size and a vertical film size. Also like field of view, if you specify both components at once it will change the aspect ratio of the lens, but if you set only the width, Panda will automatically compute the height to keep the aspect ratio the same.",
