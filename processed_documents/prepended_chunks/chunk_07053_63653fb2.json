  "content": "This chunk describes how to implement a more advanced camera control system by subclassing AsyncTask and overriding the do_task method to rotate the camera around the scene based on elapsed time, with specific details about calculating position and orientation.\n\nFor more advanced usage, you can subclass AsyncTask and override the do_task method to make it do what you want.\n\nIn our code, the procedure spinCameraTask() calculates the desired position of the camera based on how much time has elapsed. The camera rotates 6 degrees every second. The first two lines compute the desired orientation of the camera; first in degrees, and then in radians. The ~.NodePath.set_pos() call actually sets the position of the camera. (Remember that Y is horizontal and Z is vertical, so the position is changed by animating X and Y while Z is left fixed at 3 units above ground level.) The ~.NodePath.set_hpr() call actually sets the orientation.\n\nRun the Program\n\nThe camera should no longer be underground; and furthermore, it should now be rotating about the clearing:",
