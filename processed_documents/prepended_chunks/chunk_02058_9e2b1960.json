  "content": "The chunk is part of a Python module that deals with importing and managing modules, particularly focusing on handling binary file formats for macOS (Mach-O). The specific code snippet defines constants and structures related to Mach-O headers and load commands, which are used to modify or analyze binary segments during codesigning processes. This section provides low-level details necessary for interacting with binary files in a way that ensures compatibility and proper signing on macOS systems.\n\n# Since around macOS 10.15, Apple's codesigning process has become more strict.\n# Appending data to the end of a Mach-O binary is now explicitly forbidden. The\n# solution is to embed our own segment into the binary so it can be properly\n# signed.\nmach_header_64_layout = '<IIIIIIII'\n\n# Each load command is guaranteed to start with the command identifier and\n# command size.

We need to change both the segment\n# and section information, so we'll need to know the layout of a section as\n# well.\nsection64_header_layout = '<16s16sQQIIIIIIII'\n\n# These are all of the load commands we'll need to modify parts of.\nLC_SEGMENT_64 = 0x19\nLC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY = 0x80000022\nLC_SYMTAB = 0x02\nLC_DYSYMTAB = 0x0B\nLC_FUNCTION_STARTS = 0x26\nLC_DATA_IN_CODE = 0x29",
