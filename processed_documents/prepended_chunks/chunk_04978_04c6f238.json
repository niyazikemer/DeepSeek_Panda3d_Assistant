  "content": "This is part of the documentation for the `oobe()` method, which controls \"out of bounds\" mode in the 3D viewer, allowing users to temporarily pan around an object without affecting the main camera's position.\n\nThis is different than `useTrackball()`, which simply changes\n        the existing mouse action to a trackball interface.  In fact,\n        OOBE mode doesn't care whether `useDrive()` or `useTrackball()` is\n        in effect; it just temporarily layers a new trackball\n        interface on top of whatever the basic interface is.  You can\n        even switch between `useDrive()` and `useTrackball()` while OOBE\n        mode is in effect.\n\n        This is a toggle; the second time this function is called, it\n        disables the mode.\n        \"\"\"\n        if cam is None:\n            cam = self.cam\n\n        # If oobeMode was never set, set it to false and create the\n        # structures we need to implement OOBE.\n        if not hasattr(self, 'oobeMode'):\n            self.oobeMode = 0",
