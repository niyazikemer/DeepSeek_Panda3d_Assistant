  "content": "This chunk situates within a section discussing advanced terrain setup using heightfield images to create physical terrains. The code demonstrates how to scale and position a GeoMipTerrain node path to align its visual representation with its Bullet physics model. Immediately following this, the text introduces the concept of soft body shapes, noting they are specialized collision shapes used for soft bodies but cannot be directly created\u2014reserved for later discussion about soft body dynamics in the manual.\n\nterrain_root.set_scale(terrain_root.get_scale().get_x(), terrain_root.get_scale().get_y(), height);\nterrain_root.reparent_to(window->get_render());\n\nSoft Body Shape\n\nThis special collision shape is used in connection with soft bodies. It can not be created directly. Soft bodies will be discussed later within this manual.",
