  "content": "The provided chunk situates within a comprehensive guide on particle renderers in Panda3D, focusing on common parameters shared by all renderers and delving into the specifics of the PointParticleRenderer.\n\nParticle Renderers\n\nParticle renderers add particles to the visible scene graph according to the information stored in the particle objects and the type of renderer. All particle renderers have the following parameters:\n\nVariable Definition Values alphaMode Alpha setting over particle lifetime PR_ALPHA_NONE, PR_ALPHA_OUT, PR_ALPHA_IN, PR_ALPHA_USER userAlpha Alpha value for ALPHA_USER alpha mode Boolean\n\nThe following list contains the different types of renderers and their unique parameters.\n\nPointParticleRenderer\n\nRenders particles as pixel points.\n\nVariable Definition Values pointSize Width and height of points, in pixels [0, infinity) startColor Starting color (r, g, b, a) endColor Ending color (r, g, b, a) blendType How the particles blend from the start color to the end color ONE_COLOR, BLEND_LIFE, BLEND_VEL blendMethod Interpolation method between colors LINEAR, CUBIC\n\nONE_COLOR: point is always the starting color.",
