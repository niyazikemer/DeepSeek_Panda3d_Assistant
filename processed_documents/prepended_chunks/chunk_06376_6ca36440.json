  "content": "This chunk introduces the challenge of achieving accurate mouse interaction in a window with multiple display regions using Panda3D. It explains that while base.mouseWatcherNode provides mouse coordinates for the entire window, restricting it to a specific display region can prevent mouse interaction outside that area. The example illustrates this issue with two display regions\u2014a 3D view and a menu\u2014where limiting the default MouseWatcher to one region disables interaction in the other.\n\nCreating New MouseWatchers for Display Regions\n\nWhen working with multiple display regions in a single window, it can be difficult to get accurate mouse interaction. base.mouseWatcherNode, the default MouseWatcher in Panda3D, reports the mouse coordinates for the entire window. To get mouse coordinates relative to a specific display region the MouseWatcher needs to be restricted to that region with the setDisplayRegion() method.\n\nmyDR = base.win.makeDisplayRegion(0, 1, 0, 1)\nbase.mouseWatcherNode.setDisplayRegion(myDR)\n\nHowever, restricting the default MouseWatcher to a display region will prevent the mouse from being used outside of that region. For example, the image below shows two display regions, a 3D view in the top portion, and a menu in the bottom portion.\n\nIf base.mouseWatcherNode is restricted to the 3D view display region, the mouse won't interact with the menu buttons.",
