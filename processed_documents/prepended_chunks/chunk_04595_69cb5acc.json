  "content": "The given code snippet serves as the introduction to a utility module containing various functions and classes designed for general-purpose use within an application or framework. This module likely provides essential tools such as data structures (e.g., `ScratchPad`), numerical operations (`lerp`, `clamp`), debugging utilities (`printStack`), and profiling decorators (`profiled`). By defining these utilities in the built-in namespace, they become globally accessible without explicit imports, facilitating easier and quicker access across different parts of an application. The module is intended to be a comprehensive collection of helper functions and classes that support various functionalities required throughout a project.\n\n\"\"\"Contains miscellaneous utility functions and classes.\"\"\"\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\n__all__ = [",
