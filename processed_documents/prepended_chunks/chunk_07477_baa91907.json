  "content": "The chunk discusses how the PStats tool categorizes performance data into specific metrics like Show Code, Animation, and Collisions under the App category. This context is situated within the document's explanation of how PStats clients collect and transmit detailed performance information to servers for analysis, allowing developers to identify and optimize bottlenecks in their applications.\n\nThe primary collectors labeled on the left might themselves be further subdivided, if the data is provided by the client. For instance, App is often divided into Show Code, Animation, and Collisions, where Show Code is the time spent executing any Python code, Animation is the time used to compute any animated characters, and Collisions is the time spent in the collision traverser(s).",
