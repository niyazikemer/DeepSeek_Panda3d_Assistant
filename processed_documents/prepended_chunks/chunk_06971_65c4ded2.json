  "content": "The provided chunk is situated within a detailed guide on efficiently managing 3D geometry in Panda3D using memoryviews for dynamic alterations. The context explains how to handle large vertex counts by adjusting index types to prevent limitations, ensuring efficient and error-free geometry management.\n\nNote that if the model is intended to contain a large amount of vertices (whether these are all added to the geometry at creation time or afterwards), an error will occur if that number exceeds 65535. This is because the index type of a GeomPrimitive is set to GeomEnums.NT_uint16 by default. To prevent this, set the index type to GeomEnums.NT_uint32 and cast values to the 'I' format:",
