  "content": "The chunk discusses how to save 3D geometry using the `write_bam_file` method for binary .bam files and introduces the Egg Interface for creating or modifying .egg files directly within Panda3D.\n\nThe easiest way to save geometry is to use to call write_bam_file(filename) <.NodePath.write_bam_file> from the NodePath that contains your geometry.\n\nmyPanda = loader.loadModel(\"panda\")\n\n# do some fancy calculations on the normals, or texture coordinates that you\n# dont want to do at runtime\n\n# Save your new custom Panda\nmyPanda.writeBamFile(\"customPanda.bam\")\n\nThe Egg Interface\n\nOne easy way to create .egg file for geometry that has already been made is to create a .bam file and use bam2egg. However, you will often want to use the egg interface to create geometry in the first place; this is usually the easiest way to create geometry in Panda3D.",
