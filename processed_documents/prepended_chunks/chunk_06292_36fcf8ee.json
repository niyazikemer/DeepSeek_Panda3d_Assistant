  "content": "Command-line options for maya2egg exporter: detailed explanations of `-a model`, `-a chan`, `-a pose`, and `-a both` flags used in Maya to export models and animations as egg files, including their specific purposes and use cases.\n\nmaya2egg -a model -o eggFileName.egg mayaFileName.mb\nmaya2egg -a chan -o eggFileName.egg mayaFileName.mb\nmaya2egg -a pose -o eggFileName.egg mayaFileName.mb\nmaya2egg -a both -o eggFileName.egg mayaFileName.mb\n\nThe meanings of these options are:\n\n-a model Save only the skinned and boned model, ready for animation but with\nno animation attached. This is ideal for models with several event- or\ninteraction-based animations. -a chan Save only the animation data on the current model, but not the model\nitself. This is ideal applying animations to an already-existing model\negg file that is ready to receive animation. A model may have several\nanimation channels applied to it. -a pose Save the model in the current key position of the animation applied\nto it. This position must be selected before choosing to export the\nfile. This format does not save the animation. -a both This will export the model and animation out as one file.",
