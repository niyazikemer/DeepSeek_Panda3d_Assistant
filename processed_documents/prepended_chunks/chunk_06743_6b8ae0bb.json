This may\nhelp if your scene involves lots of such connected triangles, but it can\nalso make the overall stripping less effective (by interfering with\ntriangle strips). egg-coordinate-system enum default egg-coplanar-threshold double 0.01 The numerical threshold below which polygons are considered to be\ncoplanar. Determined empirically. egg-emulate-bface bool 1 When this is true, the bface flag applied to a polygon will cause\ntwo different polygons to be created, back-to-back. When it is false, a\nsingle polygon will be created with the two_sided flag set on it. egg-flat-colors bool 1 Set this true to allow the egg loader to create geometry with the\nColorAttrib::T_flat attribute set: that is, geometry that uses the scene",
