  "content": "The chunk introduces the concept of threading by explaining its importance for leveraging multi-core processors to enhance performance and execute tasks concurrently without slowing down rendering operations.\n\nThreading\n\nBy default, all code is executed on only a single processor core. However, modern processors can contain many cores that can run code simultaneously, and all this extra processing power provided by these other cores would go unused. To take advantage of these extra cores and improve a program's performance, a program's flow needs to be restructured into multiple separate threads of execution.\n\nOne reason to use multiple threads is to improve an application's performance by using the extra processing power provided by the other cores. Another is to perform long-running computations or I/O operations in the background while the foreground thread continues to do the normal frame-to-frame rendering functions without slowing down.",
