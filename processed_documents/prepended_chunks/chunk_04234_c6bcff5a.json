This specific code handles the case when the current card index exceeds the number of available cards. It ensures that each texture is associated with a window, tracks excluded textures, updates the list of cards, and checks if there are any cards left to display before continuing or terminating the task.\n\ncards.append(card)\n                    wins.append(win)\n                    exclude[tex] = 1\n        self.cards = cards\n        if len(cards) == 0:\n            self.task = 0\n            return Task.done\n        ncards = len(cards)",
