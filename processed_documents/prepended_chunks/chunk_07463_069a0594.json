  "content": "This section explains the process of transmitting data between Panda programs once a connection has been established, covering the construction of messages using PyDatagram objects for sending.\n\nTransmitting Data\n\nOnce a connection has been established, data can be transmitted from one Panda program to another using the classes described in this section. Communication can happen in both directions (i.e. client-to-server or server-to-client); once the connection has been established, either side may send messages along the connection to the other side.\n\nThis section describes message passing in detail, first transmission, then receipt of a message.\n\nSending a message\n\nTo send a message along an established connection, the sender must first construct a PyDatagram containing the message. This involves instantiating a PyDatagram object and then populating its contents with the desired data. The type of the data is determined by the functions used to pack it; see the full documentation of the PyDatagram class for more details.",
