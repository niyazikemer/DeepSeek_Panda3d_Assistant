  "content": "The document provides an overview of Panda's datagram protocol, which forms the foundation for its networking capabilities. It describes how developer-defined packets can be transmitted using UDP or TCP protocols and introduces key classes for establishing connections and transmitting data.\n\nDatagram Protocol\n\nUnderpinning Panda's networking capabilities are the classes that compose the datagram protocol. These classes allow for developer-defined packets to be transmitted using either the UDP or TCP protocols. Panda's datagram layer can serve as a solid foundation for developing higher-level networking abstractions.\n\nThis section describes the classes used to establish a connection (.QueuedConnectionManager, .QueuedConnectionListener, .QueuedConnectionReader, and .ConnectionWriter), as well as the classes that transmit information (.NetDatagram, .PyDatagram, and .PyDatagramIterator).\n\nclient-server-connection transmitting-data",
