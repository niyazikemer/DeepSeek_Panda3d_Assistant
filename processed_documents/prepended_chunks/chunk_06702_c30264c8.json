  "content": "The chunk discusses important considerations when configuring `setup.py` for a Panda3D project, specifically focusing on the licensing implications of third-party libraries used by certain plug-ins and the default platform tags that determine compatibility with different operating systems.\n\nNote that some plug-ins use third-party libraries that may have different licensing terms from Panda3D. More information about these libraries can be found here <thirdparty-licenses>. Please review the licensing terms of these libraries before including the respective plug-in!\n\nPlatform Tags\n\nBy default, Panda3D will build for 64-bit versions of Windows, macOS and Linux. More specifically, platform tags are used to specify the minimum version and architecture of the operating system supported by a Python package. You can specify these platforms explicitly to customize the targeted platforms and their versions. The default set, as of Python 3.7, is as follows:\n\n'platforms': ['manylinux1_x86_64', 'macosx_10_6_x86_64', 'win_amd64'],\n\nOn more recent versions of Python, newer defaults are used. See the list below for details.",
