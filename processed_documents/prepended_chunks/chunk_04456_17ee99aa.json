  "content": "The chunk defines methods to set and get minimum and maximum distance parameters for sound effects in a 3D audio system. These methods control how sounds attenuate based on their proximity to the listener. The `setSoundMinDistance` method sets the distance at which sound begins to fall off, while `setSoundMaxDistance` determines the point beyond which the sound no longer decreases in volume. Both are essential for managing sound attenuation behavior in a 3D environment.\n\n```python\n    def setSoundMinDistance(self, sound, dist):\n        \"\"\"Controls the minimum distance (in units) at which sound begins to attenuate.\n        Default is 3.28 units (equivalent to 1 meter).\"\"\"\n        sound.oid = sound.set3dMinDistance(dist)\n\n    def getSoundMinDistance(self, sound):\n        \"\"\"Retrieves the minimum distance (in units) at which sound begins to attenuate.\"\"\"\n        return sound.get3dMinDistance()\n\n    def setSoundMaxDistance(self, sound, dist):\n        \"\"\"Sets the maximum distance (in units) beyond which sound attenuation stops.\n        Default is 1000000000.0 units.\"\"\"\n        sound.set3dMaxDistance(dist)\n```\n\ndef setSoundMinDistance(self, sound, dist):\n        \"\"\"\n        Controls the distance (in units) that this sound begins to fall off.\n        Also affects the rate it falls off.\n        Default is 3.28 (in feet, this is 1 meter)\n        Don't forget to change this when you change the DistanceFactor\n        \"\"\"\n        sound.set3dMinDistance(dist)\n\n    def getSoundMinDistance(self, sound):\n        \"\"\"\n        Controls the distance (in units) that this sound begins to fall off.\n        Also affects the rate it falls off.\n        Default is 3.28 (in feet, this is 1 meter)\n        \"\"\"\n        return sound.get3dMinDistance()\n\n    def setSoundMaxDistance(self, sound, dist):\n        \"\"\"\n        Controls the maximum distance (in units) that this sound stops falling off.\n        The sound does not stop at that point, it just doesn't get any quieter.\n        You should rarely need to adjust this.\n        Default is 1000000000.0\n        \"\"\"\n        sound.set3dMaxDistance(dist)",
