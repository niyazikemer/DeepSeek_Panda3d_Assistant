  "content": "This chunk provides a detailed example of how to implement state transitions in a Finite State Machine (FSM) using Panda3D, showcasing a more complex scenario involving walk, swim, and drowning states with intermediate transition animations. It emphasizes the benefits of using an FSM for managing numerous states and transitions efficiently, ensuring proper cleanup when transitioning between states, and simplifying code management compared to manually handling each state's entry and exit logic.\n\ntransitions\n\nrankdir=LR node [style=rounded, shape=box]\n\nWalk -> Walk2Swim; Walk2Swim -> Swim; Swim -> Swim2Walk; Swim2Walk -> Walk; Swim -> Drowning;\n\n{ rank=same; Walk2Swim; Swim2Walk; }\n\nIn a real-world example, you might easily find you have a need for dozens of states. This is when using the FSM class to manage all of these transitions for you can really make things a lot simpler; if you had to keep all of that cleanup code in your head, it can very quickly get out of hand.\n\ncpp\n\nThis section does not apply to C++ users.",
