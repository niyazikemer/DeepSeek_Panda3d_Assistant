  "content": "The chunk is part of a tutorial in the Panda3D documentation explaining how to manipulate actor joints to achieve \"looking\" and \"gripping\" effects by controlling the neck and hand joints.\n\nSpecifically in this tutorial, we will take control of the neck joint of a humanoid character and rotate that joint to always face the mouse cursor. This will in turn make the head of the character \"look\" at the mouse cursor. We will also expose the hand joint using exposeJoint and use its positional data to \"attach\" objects that the character can hold. By using exposeJoint, the object will stay in the character's hand even if the hand is moving through an animation.\n\nNote\n\nModels with joints will differ greatly from each other depending on how they were made and who made them. You may find that a certain model's joints are not oriented logically or practically. Also beware that joints may have limits on how far they can twist. Going beyond a joints limits may cause strange and unwanted deformations.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
