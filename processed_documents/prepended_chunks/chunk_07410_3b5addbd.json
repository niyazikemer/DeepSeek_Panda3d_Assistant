  "content": "\"Example demonstrating creation of an AI object on the server using createDistributedObject and handling its announcement on clients.\"\n\nAn example for creating an AI object directly on the AI server follows.\n\nself.gameDistObjectAI = self.createDistributedObject(\n    className = 'DGameObjectAI',\n    zoneId = 2)\n\nFor a client to know when such an object has been manifested locally, the distributed object class (without the AI postfix) can overwrite the ~direct.distributed.DistributedObject.DistributedObject.announceGenerate() method of .DistributedObject. This method is called whenever the object has been created and is ready for further processing on the client. In this method, you can for example send the doId with a custom event or simply store some information in the client repository to later ease the access to those objects.",
