  "content": "The chunk discusses the `forceTransition()` method within the context of an FSM guide, explaining its function and usage compared to other state transition mechanisms like `request()` and `demand()`.\n\nThere is also a method fsm.forceTransition() <direct.fsm.FSM.FSM.forceTransition>. This is similar to demand() in that it never fails and does not have a return value, but it's different in that it completely bypasses the filter function. You should therefore only pass an uppercase state name (along with any optional arguments) to forceTransition, never a lowercase input string. The FSM will always transition to the named state, even if it wouldn't otherwise be allowed. Thus, forceTransition() can be useful in special cases to skip to another state that's not necessarily connected to the current state (for instance, to handle emergency cleanup when an exception occurs). Be careful that you don't overuse forceTransition(), though; consider whether demand() would be a better choice. If you find yourself making lots of calls to forceTransition(), it may be that your filter functions (or your defaultTransitions) are poorly written and are disallowing what should be legitimate state",
