  "content": "The code chunk is part of a Python class called `ReferrerSearch`, which is designed to trace reference chains in memory to find how objects are referenced by other parts of an application. This specific portion of the code handles the logic for exploring each referrer recursively, checking if an object has too many references (indicating it may be a global or singleton) and deciding whether to stop or continue tracing up the reference tree.\n\nContext: The chunk is part of the `stepGenerator` method in a class used for tracing reference chains, handling reference count checks and recursive exploration of referrers.\n\n# Check to see if this object has an unusually large\n        # ref-count.  This usually indicates that it is some\n        # sort of global, singleton, or manager object\n        # and as such no further knowledge would be gained from\n        # traversing further up the ref tree.\n        if self.isManyRef(at, path, referrers):\n            return\n\n        while referrers:\n            ref = referrers.pop()\n            self.depth += 1\n            for x in self.stepGenerator(depth + 1, path + [ref]):\n                pass\n            self.depth -= 1\n\n    def stepGenerator(self, depth, path):\n        if self.shouldPrintStats:\n            self.printStats(path)\n\n            self.shouldPrintStats = False\n\n        at = path[-1]\n\n        # check for success\n        if self.isAtRoot(at, path):\n            self.found += 1\n            raise StopIteration\n\n        if id(at) in self.visited:\n            # don't continue down this path\n            raise StopIteration",
