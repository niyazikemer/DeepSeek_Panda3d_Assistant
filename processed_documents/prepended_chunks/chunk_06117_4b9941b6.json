  "content": "The provided code demonstrates how to implement non-blocking file downloads in a game using HTTPClient and HTTPChannel. The specific chunk describes an alternative method for downloading files directly to a specified filename instead of storing them temporarily in memory (RAM). It also includes functionality to monitor the download progress by querying the channel for bytes downloaded, file size, and percentage completion. This allows developers to provide feedback on the download status while the game remains responsive.\n\nYou can also download to file\n\nchannel.downloadToFile(Filename(fileName))\n\nThe file channel can be queried for further information while the game is running to get the current download state.\n\nmbDownloaded = self.channel.getBytesDownloaded() / 1024 / 1024\npercentDownloaded = 100. * self.channel.getBytesDownloaded() / channel.getFileSize()",
