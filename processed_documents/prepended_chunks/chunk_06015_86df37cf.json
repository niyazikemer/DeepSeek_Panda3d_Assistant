  "content": "The provided chunk describes the initial steps to create and run a basic Panda3D application in Python, including importing modules, defining a main class inheriting from ShowBase, and running the application. It is part of a larger document that also covers creating applications in C++.\n\nStarting Panda3D\n\npython\n\nCreating a New Panda3D Application\n\nShowBase\n\nTo start Panda3D, create a text file and save it with the .py extension. PYPE, SPE and IDLE are Python-specific text-editors, but any text editor will work. Enter the following text into your Python file:\n\nfrom direct.showbase.ShowBase import ShowBase\n\n\nclass MyApp(ShowBase):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        ShowBase.__init__(self)\n\n\napp = MyApp()\napp.run()\n\nHere we made our main class inherit from ~direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase. This class loads most of the other Panda3D modules, and causes the 3D window to appear. The ~direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.run() method contains the Panda3D main loop. It renders a frame, handles the background tasks, and then repeats. It does not normally return, so it needs to be called only once and must be the last line in your script. In this particular example, there will be nothing to render, so you should expect a window containing an empty grey area.\n\nRunning the Program",
