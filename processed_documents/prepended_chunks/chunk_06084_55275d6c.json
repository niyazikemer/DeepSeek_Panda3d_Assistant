  "content": "The document discusses how to create and use StereoDisplayRegions in Panda3D for rendering 3-D scenes. It explains how to set up stereo output through various configurations and describes the technical details of controlling stereo frustums and lens parameters.\n\nSetting the stereo channel to left or right also resets the texture view offset associated with the DisplayRegion: the default tex view offset is 0 for the left eye, and 1 for the right eye. This allows dual-view stereo textures to render properly in the DisplayRegion, so that the left view is visible in the left eye and the right view in the right eye. See Stereo/Multiview Textures <multiview-textures> for more about this feature.\n\nThe lens parameters can be controlled via .Lens.set_interocular_distance() and .Lens.set_convergence_distance(), or by the equivalent Config.prc settings default-iod and default-converge. Refer to the following illustration:",
