  "content": "This file provides an implementation of a mirror effect in Panda3D, demonstrating how to create a mirrored view using offscreen rendering. The core functionality is encapsulated in the `setupMirror()` function, which configures an offscreen buffer with its own camera, dynamically repositioned each frame to maintain the reflection relative to the main camera's viewpoint. This approach not only creates a realistic mirror effect but also illustrates broader techniques for rendering virtual displays or surveillance feeds within a scene.\n\n\"\"\"This file demonstrates one way to create a mirror effect in Panda.\nCall :func:`setupMirror()` to create a mirror in the world that reflects\neverything in front of it.\n\nThe approach taken here is to create an offscreen buffer with its own\ncamera that renders its view into a texture, which is then applied to\nthe mirror geometry.  The mirror's camera is repositioned each frame\nwith a task to keep it always on the opposite side of the mirror from\nthe main camera.\n\nThis demonstrates the basic interface for offscreen\nrender-to-a-texture in Panda.  Similar approaches can be used for\nrelated effects, such as a remote spy camera presenting its view onto\na closed-circuit television screen.",
