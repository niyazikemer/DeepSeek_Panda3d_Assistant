  "content": "The context situates the chunk within a comprehensive guide on using glTF files in Panda3D, detailing their extensibility and technical aspects like vector handling.\n\nThe glTF format is defined as an extensible format. A glTF asset can opt-in to a number of externally defined extensions that add additional functionality not provided by the base standard.\n\nBoth the panda3d-gltf and Assimp plug-ins support the following extensions, among others:\n\nKHR_lights_punctual - adds support for light sources\n\nKHR_texture_transform - adds support for texture transformations <texture-transforms>\n\nKHR_materials_ior - makes it possible to specify the index of refraction of a material\n\nTangent and Binormal Vectors\n\nglTF files do not contain binormal vectors, even if normal mapping is used. This may be an issue when using custom shaders that expect a binormal vector to be present for normal mapping. Instead, binormal vectors are intended to be derived from the cross product of the normal and tangent vectors.",
