  "content": "The provided chunk is part of the `_pruneObjectRefs` method within the `PruneObjectRefs` job class. This method iterates over object references stored in dictionaries (`_id2baseStartRef` and `_id2discoveredStartRef`) and attempts to validate them by accessing their associated containers via generator methods. If an exception is raised during this access (indicating the reference is invalid), the corresponding entry is removed from the dictionary to clean up stale or dangling references. This code helps maintain the integrity of object tracking within the system by periodically pruning invalid entries.\n\nThis functionality is part of a larger framework for detecting and managing memory leaks or invalid object references in an application, likely within a game or simulation environment given the use of task managers and job systems.\n\n# reference is invalid, remove it\n                    del _id2baseStartRef[id]\n            _id2discoveredStartRef = self._leakDetector._findContainersJob._id2discoveredStartRef\n            ids = list(_id2discoveredStartRef.keys())\n            for id in ids:\n                yield None\n                try:\n                    for container in _id2discoveredStartRef[id].getContainerGen():\n                        yield None\n                except Exception:\n                    # reference is invalid, remove it\n                    del _id2discoveredStartRef[id]\n        except Exception as e:\n            print('PruneObjectRefs job caught exception: %s' % e)\n            if __dev__:\n                raise\n        yield Job.Done",
