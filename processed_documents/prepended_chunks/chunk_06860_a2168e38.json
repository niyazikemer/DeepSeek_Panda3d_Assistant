  "content": "This chunk describes texture-related configuration properties in Panda3D, including settings for filtering, quality levels, and scaling factors that affect how textures are rendered in 3D graphics applications.\n\nproperties. texture-minfilter enum linear This specifies the default minfilter that is applied to a texture in\nthe absence of a specific minfilter setting. Normally this is either\n'linear' to disable mipmapping by default, or 'mipmap', to enable\ntrilinear mipmapping by default. This does not apply to depth textures.\nNote if this variable is changed at runtime, you may need to reload\ntextures explicitly in order to change their visible properties. texture-quality-level enum normal This specifies a global quality level for all textures. You may\nspecify either fastest, normal, or best. This actually affects the\nmeaning of Texture::set_quality_level(QL_default), so it may be\noverridden on a per-texture basis. This generally only has an effect\nwhen using the tinydisplay software renderer; it has little or no effect\non normal, hardware-accelerated renderers. See\nTexture::set_quality_level(). texture-scale double 1.0 This is a global scale factor that is applied to each texture as it",
