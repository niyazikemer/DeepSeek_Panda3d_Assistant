  "content": "The chunk discusses the limitations of manually writing shaders for specific scenarios in Panda3D, highlighting how such shaders are constrained to particular conditions like single textures, lighting setups, and lack of vertex colors. It explains that these constraints make creating versatile programs with custom shaders challenging, which is why Panda3D's shader synthesis feature was developed to handle a wide variety of models more effectively without requiring manual adjustments for each case.\n\nThe second problem with writing your own shader is that shaders must be hardwired to a very limited set of circumstances. The shader included with this sample program is hardwired for models with a single diffuse texture and a single normal map. It is hardwired for absence of vertex colors. It implements one white point light and one white ambient light. Changing any of these parameters would require a different shader.\n\nThis is not because the shader was written lazily. It is because shaders are by nature specialized to a specific combination of model attributes. This makes it rather awkward to write a substantial program that uses manually-written shaders. This is a big part of the reason that panda now supports shader synthesis - the shader generator can handle almost any kind of model.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
