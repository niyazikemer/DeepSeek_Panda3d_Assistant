  "content": "The provided chunk represents the initial header section of a Python module named `StateData`, which is designed as a base class for managing individual states within a Finite State Machine (FSM) framework. The module includes essential imports from Panda3D libraries, specifically `DirectNotifyGlobal` for logging and notifications, and `DirectObject` for object management within the application's context. This setup establishes the foundational structure for the `StateData` class, which is used to handle state transitions, resource loading, and event handling in FSM implementations.\n\n\"\"\"StateData module: contains StateData class\"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ['StateData']\n\nfrom direct.directnotify.DirectNotifyGlobal import directNotify\nfrom direct.showbase.DirectObject import DirectObject",
