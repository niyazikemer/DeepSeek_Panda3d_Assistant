  "content": "The chunk describes how to remove texture specifications added via TextureStages in both Python and C++ using `clearTexture` or `clear_texture` methods, either for a specific TextureStage or all previously added textures on a node, while leaving original model textures intact.\n\ncpp\n\nsmiley.clear_texture(ts);\n\npassing in the same TextureStage that you used before. Or, alternatively, you may simply use:\n\npython\n\nsmiley.clearTexture()\n\ncpp\n\nsmiley.clear_texture();\n\nto remove all texture specifications that you previously added to the node smiley. This does not remove the original textures that were on the model when you loaded it; those textures are assigned at a different node level, on the Geom objects that make up the model.",
