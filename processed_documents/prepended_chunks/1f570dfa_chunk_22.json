  "content": "The chunk appears in a section titled \"Shaders,\" which explains how 3D video cards evolved from fixed-feature designs to programmable units through shaders. The chunk specifically discusses two key aspects of shader usage: Panda3D's automatic handling of advanced rendering techniques without user intervention, and when users need to write custom shaders for unique effects beyond Panda3D's built-in capabilities.\n\nAutomatic use of Shaders\n\nPanda3D supports several advanced rendering techniques such as per-pixel lighting, normal mapping, gloss mapping, glow mapping, HDR, bloom, and cartoon inking out of the box. In order to make these work, Panda is quietly uploading shaders to your video card. You don't need to write shaders to use these features, or even know much about shaders. You just turn these features on. To learn how to turn these features on, read about these features in their own sections of the manual.\n\nWriting your own Shaders\n\nIf what you want to do is one of the things that Panda already supports automatically, such as per-pixel lighting, normal mapping, gloss mapping, glow mapping, HDR, bloom, or cartoon inking, you don't need to write any shaders. Just let Panda handle it.",
