  "content": "The chunk describes configuration variables related to graphics rendering, including sprite transformation in clip space, fog effects, GSG sampler object limits, and stereo display settings.\n\nsprite points from object space into clip space, and compute the corners\nof the quads in clip space. When this variable is false, the resulting\nquads are then sent to the graphics hardware in clip space. When this is\ntrue, the quads are re-transformed back into the original object space,\nwhich is necessary in order for fog to work correctly on the\nsprites. sampler-object-limit int 2048 This is a default limit that is imposed on each GSG at GSG creation\ntime. It limits the total amount of sampler objects that will be k.ept\nby the GSG, regardless of whether the hardware claims to provide more\nsampler objects than this. Direct3D 10-capable hardware supports at\nleast 4096 distinct sampler objects, but we provide a slightly more\nconservative limit by default. sbs-left-dimensions double 0.0 0.5 0.0 1.0 Defines the default region of the window that is used for the left\neye, when side-by-side stereo is enabled. This is a set of four numbers,",
