  "content": "This chunk explains how to use intervals and sequences in Panda3D to animate a panda character, moving it back and forth between two points while turning around. It includes code examples for Python and C++ to implement this animation using intervals for position and heading changes over specified durations.\n\nUsing Intervals to move the Panda\n\nIntervals and Sequences\n\nintervals\n\nIntervals are tasks that change a property from one value to another over a specified period of time. Starting an interval effectively starts a background process that modifies the property over the specified period of time.\n\nSequences <sequences-and-parallels>\n\nSequences, sometimes called MetaIntervals, are a type of interval that contains other intervals. Playing a sequence will cause each contained interval to execute in sequence, one after the other.\n\nThe Program\n\nUpdate the Code\n\nThe next step is to cause the panda to actually move back and forth. Update the code to the following:\n\npython\n\nusing-intervals-to-move-the-panda.py\n\ncpp\n\nusing-intervals-to-move-the-panda.cxx",
