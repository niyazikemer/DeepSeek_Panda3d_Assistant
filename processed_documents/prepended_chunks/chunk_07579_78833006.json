  "content": "The chunk describes several executables found in the `/bin/` folder of Panda3D, which are used for various tasks related to 3D model manipulation, file format conversion, and shader compilation. These tools include utilities for converting between `.bam` and `.egg` formats, manipulating `.egg` files (e.g., cropping, creating tubes, and generating fonts from `.ttf` files), compiling Cg shaders, processing AutoCAD DXF files into `.egg` models, and other related operations.\n\nFilename Description bam-info.exe Scans one or more .bam files and outputs their contents. See\nexecutable for more information. bam2egg.exe Converts models in the .bam format to the .egg format. For more\ninformation see converting-egg-to-bam . cgc.exe A compiler for NVidia\u2019s Cg language. For more information see Using Cg Shaders <shader-basics> . dxf-points.exe Reads in an AutoCad .dxf file and prints out the points contained in\nit. See executable for more information. dxf2egg.exe Converts models from the AutoCad format to the .egg format. For more\ninformation see converting-to-egg egg-crop.exe Strips an .egg file of all parts that fall outside the given\nbounding volume. See executable for more information. egg-make-tube.exe Creates an .egg file representing a \u201ctube\u201d model. See executable for\nmore information. egg-mkfont.exe Makes a .egg file from a FreeType (.ttf) font. For more information",
