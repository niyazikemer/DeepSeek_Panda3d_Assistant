  "content": "The context situates the chunk as instructions for resolving an issue where Python isn't recognized, likely due to incorrect PATH settings post-installation.\n\nThe chunk provides step-by-step guidance on manually updating the system's PATH environment variable to include Panda3D's necessary directories when automatic configuration fails. This solution is aimed at users encountering a 'python is not recognized' error after installing Panda3D on Windows.\n\nIf you have administrator access to the PC, select the PATH line in the list under System Variables, otherwise, select the PATH line in the list of personal environment Variables.\n\nNow double-click the PATH (or Path) line. A small window opens containing a series of directories separated by semicolons. Add Panda3D's bin and python directories to the end of the PATH.\n\nIt may be necessary to log off and log back in to obtain the updated settings.",
