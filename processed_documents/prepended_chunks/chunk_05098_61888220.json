  "content": "The `setCutoffDistance` and `getCutoffDistance` methods in the `SfxPlayer` class manage distance-based volume cutoffs for sound effects. These methods control how far a sound can be heard before it becomes inaudible, adjusting based on either inverse square or linear attenuation models. They are used during initialization to set up the audio system's distance limits and scaling factors for realistic sound localization.\n\ndef setCutoffDistance(self, d):\n        self.cutoffDistance = d\n        # this is the 'raw' distance at which the volume of a sound will\n        # be equal to the cutoff volume\n        rawCutoffDistance = math.sqrt(1./self.cutoffVolume)\n        # this is a scale factor to convert distances so that a sound\n        # located at self.cutoffDistance will have a volume\n        # of self.cutoffVolume\n        self.distanceScale = rawCutoffDistance / self.cutoffDistance\n\n    def getCutoffDistance(self):\n        \"\"\"Return the curent cutoff distance.\"\"\"\n        return self.cutoffDistance",
