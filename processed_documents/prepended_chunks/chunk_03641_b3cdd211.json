  "content": "This code chunk is part of a method within the `ValuatorGroupPanel` class that handles command execution after initialization. It checks if the component has been initialized (`self.fInit`) and if there's an associated command to execute. If so, it calls the command with the adjusted value and any additional data specified by the user. This ensures that commands are only executed once initialization is complete, preventing unintended behavior during setup.\n\nif fCommand and self.fInit and (self['command'] is not None):\n            self['command'](*[value] + self['commandData'])\n        # Record adjusted value\n        self.adjustedValue = value\n        # Once initialization is finished, allow commands to execute\n        self.fInit = 1",
