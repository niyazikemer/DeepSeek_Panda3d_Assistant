  "content": "This chunk is situated within a guide detailing methods to export 3D models from Blender to Panda3D. It specifically addresses using the glTF exporter and an older alternative method involving YABEE. The context covers essential steps for modern users aiming to leverage glTF's benefits while also mentioning legacy tools for compatibility with older Blender versions.\n\n**Context:**\nThe chunk provides guidance on exporting models from Blender to Panda3D, focusing on the glTF format and settings, followed by a note on using the outdated YABEE add-on for specific cases.\n\nThe glTF exporter interface can be opened by going to File > Export > glTF 2.0:\n\nThe exporter interface provides many settings that can be customized, but the settings indicated in the image above provide a good starting point. After dialing in the settings and selecting the file path, click \"Export glTF 2.0\" to produce the glTF file.\n\nOnce you have the .gltf (or .glb) file, follow the instructions on this page <gltf-files> to load the model into Panda3D.\n\nOption 3: Exporting to Egg\n\nThere is a community-provided Blender add-on called YABEE, which adds an option to the Blender GUI for exporting egg-files. This is considered the most mature and stable add-on for Blender, however, it only works with Blender 2.5x, 2.6x and 2.7x. It does not work with newer versions, and as such is no longer recommended.\n\nIf you are using one of these older versions of Blender, however, this plug-in may still be useful to you:\n\nhttps://github.com/09th/YABEE\n\nCaution",
