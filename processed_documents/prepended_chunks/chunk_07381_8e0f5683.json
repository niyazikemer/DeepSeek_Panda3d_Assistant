  "content": "The chunk focuses on specific collision solids: CollisionCapsule and CollisionInvSphere. It explains how they are defined, used in collision tests, and their unique properties, such as the capsule being cylindrical and the inverse sphere acting as a boundary.\n\nThe capsule is good as an \"into\" object, for objects that are largely cylindrical. It can also be used as a \"from\" object, but keep in mind that it can be significantly more expensive to use a capsule in tests than a sphere.\n\nA capsule is defined with its two endpoints, and the cylindrical radius.\n\ncapsule = CollisionCapsule(ax, ay, az, bx, by, bz, radius)\n\nCollisionInvSphere\n\nThe inverse sphere is a special-purpose solid that is rarely used, but occasionally it is very useful. It is an inside-out sphere: the solid part of the sphere is on the outside. Any object that is on the outside of the sphere is considered to be colliding with it; any object on the inside is not colliding.\n\nThink of the inverse sphere as a solid mass that fills the whole universe in all directions, except for a bubble of space in the middle. It's useful for constraining an object within a particular space, since nothing can get out of an inverse sphere.\n\ninv = CollisionInvSphere(cx, cy, cz, radius)",
