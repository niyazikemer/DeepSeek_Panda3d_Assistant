  "content": "The provided code chunk consists of essential imports required for implementing avatar control functionality. These include components from Direct and Panda3D libraries related to collision handling, task management, physics, and 3D math operations. The imports are foundational dependencies that enable features such as movement controls, physics simulation, and event handling in the avatar control system.\n\n**Context:** This code chunk represents import statements for necessary modules and classes required for implementing an avatar control system with physics-based movement and collision handling. These imports are located at the beginning of the document to establish essential components needed for the functionality described in the class `handleAvatarControls`.\n\nfrom direct.directnotify import DirectNotifyGlobal\nfrom direct.showbase import DirectObject\nfrom direct.controls.ControlManager import CollisionHandlerRayStart\nfrom direct.showbase.InputStateGlobal import inputState\nfrom direct.showbase.MessengerGlobal import messenger\nfrom direct.task.Task import Task\nfrom direct.task.TaskManagerGlobal import taskMgr\nfrom direct.extensions_native import Mat3_extensions # pylint: disable=unused-import\nfrom direct.extensions_native import VBase3_extensions # pylint: disable=unused-import\nfrom direct.extensions_native import VBase4_extensions # pylint: disable=unused-import\nfrom panda3d.core import (\n    BitMask32,\n    ClockObject,\n    CollisionHandlerFloor,\n    CollisionHandlerQueue,\n    CollisionNode,\n    CollisionRay,\n    CollisionSphere,\n    CollisionTraverser,\n    ConfigVariableBool,\n    LRotationf,\n    Mat3,\n    NodePath,\n    Point3,\n    Vec3,\n)\nfrom panda3d.physics import (\n    ActorNode,\n    ForceNode,\n    LinearEulerIntegrator,",
