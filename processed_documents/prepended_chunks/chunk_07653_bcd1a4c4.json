  "content": "To create a cone/twist constraint between two rigid bodies in Bullet using Python:\n\n1. **Define Spatial Frames**: \n   - Use `TransformState.makePosHpr` to set up frames for both bodies A and B. The positions (e.g., (0, 0, -5) and (0, 0, 5)) are relative offsets from each body's origin, determining where the constraint is applied.\n   - Rotations align the cone's orientation correctly relative to the bodies.\n\n2. **Create Constraint**:\n   - Instantiate `BulletConeTwistConstraint` with both bodies and their frames.\n\n3. **Set Properties and Limits**:\n   - Use `setDebugDrawSize` for visualization.\n   - Define limits using `setLimit(swing1, swing2, twist)` where swing angles control cone opening directions and twist limits rotation around the axis.\n\n4. **Attach to World**:\n   - Add the constraint to the physics world with `world.attachConstraint(cs)`.\n\nThis setup ensures the bodies move within specified angular constraints relative to each other or a fixed point in the world.\n\nIn order to create the cone/twist constraint we have to define the spatial frames of the cone/twist connector point, as seen from body A and from body B. Then we need to create a new instance of .BulletConeTwistConstraint, by passing both bodies and both transforms to the constructor. Once created, we can set properties like the scale of the debug visualization of this constraint, as well as limits. Finally, we add the new constraint to the physics world.\n\npython\n\nframeA = TransformState.makePosHpr(Point3(0, 0, -5), Vec3(0, 0, -90))\nframeB = TransformState.makePosHpr(Point3(0, 0, 5), Vec3(0, 0, -90))\n\nswing1 = 60 # degrees\nswing2 = 36 # degrees\ntwist = 120 # degrees\n\ncs = BulletConeTwistConstraint(npA.node(), npB.node(), frameA, frameB)\ncs.setDebugDrawSize(2.0)\ncs.setLimit(swing1, swing2, twist)\nworld.attachConstraint(cs)\n\nIn this case we have set the following limits:\n\nAngle of the cone opening in first direction (swing span 1)",
