  "content": "The chunk discusses material setup requirements and PBR rendering considerations when exporting Blender models to Panda3D. It appears after explaining how to set up materials correctly and before addressing shader solutions for accurate visual reproduction.\n\nContext: \n\nThis section explains the specific material setup required for correct conversion from Blender to Panda3D, including using Principled BSDF nodes and connecting them properly. It also addresses rendering differences between Blender's PBR model and Panda3D's implementation, suggesting solutions like custom shaders for accurate results.\n\nThis does mean that your materials need to be structured in a certain way in order for them to be converted correctly. For example, you must use the Principled BSDF shader node in your materials, and connect its output directly to the Surface input of the Material Output node. More information on the limitations of the Blender exporter can be found in the Blender manual (though note that not all features mentioned here are supported by Panda3D):\n\nhttps://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/import_export/scene_gltf2.html\n\nPBR Rendering\n\nBlender 2.80 and above use a physically-based rendering model to render materials. As of this time of writing, Panda3D's shader generator does not implement such a rendering model. If you wish to get a rendering result that approaches the way the model appears in Blender, you need to use a shader that applies lighting in a similar way to Blender.",
