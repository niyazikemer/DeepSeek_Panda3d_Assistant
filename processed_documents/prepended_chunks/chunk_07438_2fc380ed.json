  "content": "The chunk appears towards the end of a sample program explanation for a Chessboard example in Panda3D, discussing interactive mouse cursor usage with collision detection. It situates itself as a note about alternative methods (using Plane class) while emphasizing that this specific sample demonstrates the Collision system approach.\n\nNote that there's a much faster way to achieve this, using the Plane class. However, this sample demonstrates how it can be done using the Collision system.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
