  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a Python class named `ClockDelta`, which handles time synchronization between client and server timestamps. This method, `newDelta`, is responsible for updating the internal time delta based on new measurements while considering uncertainties in the existing and new data to improve accuracy and reliability of time synchronization.\n\nSuccinct Context: The chunk defines the `newDelta` method within a class managing network time synchronization, where it updates the time offset using both previous and new measurements to enhance accuracy.\n\nreturn gotSync\n\n    def newDelta(self, localTime, newDelta, newUncertainty,\n                 trustNew = 1):\n        \"\"\"\n        Accepts a new delta and uncertainty pair, understood to\n        represent time as of localTime.  Improves our current notion\n        of the time delta accordingly.  The return value is true if\n        the new measurement was used, false if it was discarded.\n        \"\"\"\n        oldUncertainty = self.getUncertainty()\n        if oldUncertainty is not None:\n            self.notify.info(\n                'previous delta at %.3f s, +/- %.3f s.' %\n                (self.delta, oldUncertainty))\n            self.notify.info(\n                'new delta at %.3f s, +/- %.3f s.' %\n                (newDelta, newUncertainty))\n            # Our previous measurement was self.delta +/- oldUncertainty;\n            # our new measurement is newDelta +/- newUncertainty.
