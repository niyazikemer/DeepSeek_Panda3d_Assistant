The code checks if the current object (`curObj`) is `None` and raises an exception if so, then dereferences a dictionary key from the current object. After processing each indirection in a loop, it releases them to free resources.\n\nContext: The code is part of a method within the `ContainerSearcher` class that resolves object references while searching for specific container types or names, ensuring proper error handling and resource management during traversal.\n\nif curObj is None:\n                    raise FailedEval(evalStr)\n                # try to look up this key in the curObj dictionary\n                curObj = indirection.dereferenceDictKey(curObj)\n                evalStr = ''\n        for indirection in indirections:\n            yield None\n            indirection.release()",
