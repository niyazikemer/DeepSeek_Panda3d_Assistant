  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a Python class named `Functor`, which appears within a larger document containing various utility functions and classes. The `Functor` class is designed to encapsulate function calls with predefined arguments and keyword arguments, allowing for flexible and reusable delayed execution of functions. \n\nThe methods `_do__call__` and `__repr__` are crucial components of this functionality:\n\n1. **`_do__call__` Method**: This method enables the `Functor` instance to be called as if it were a function. It combines any predefined arguments (`self._args`) with new arguments passed during the call (`*args`) and similarly merges predefined keyword arguments (`self._kargs`) with those provided in the call (`**kargs`). The combined arguments are then used to invoke the stored function (`self._function`), facilitating a flexible way to execute functions with both fixed and dynamic parameters.\n\n2. **`__repr__` Method**: This method provides a string representation of the `Functor` instance, which includes the name of the encapsulated function, its predefined arguments, and keyword arguments. The `__repr__` method is designed to be informative for debugging purposes, especially when dealing with complex or nested `Functor` instances.\n\nThe `Functor` class appears to be part of a collection of utility classes and functions, possibly within a larger software library or framework, aimed at providing flexible and reusable mechanisms for function execution and manipulation.\n\ndef _do__call__(self, *args, **kargs):\n        _kargs = self._kargs.copy()\n        _kargs.update(kargs)\n        return self._function(*(self._args + args), **_kargs)\n\n    __call__ = _do__call__\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        s = 'Functor(%s' % self._function.__name__\n        for arg in self._args:\n            try:\n                argStr = repr(arg)\n            except Exception:\n                argStr = 'bad repr: %s' % arg.__class__\n            s += ', %s' % argStr\n        for karg, value in list(self._kargs.items()):\n            s += ', %s=%s' % (karg, repr(value))\n        s += ')'\n        return s",
