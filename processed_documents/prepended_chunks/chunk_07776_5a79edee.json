  "content": "The chunk discusses Panda3D's development history, its release as free software in 2002 by Disney for Toontown Online, Carnegie Mellon University's role in transitioning it into an open-source project, and the current collaborative development between Disney and global contributors. It also highlights that Panda3D is a professional tool designed for skilled programmers rather than beginners.\n\nPanda3D was developed by Disney for their massively multiplayer online game, Toontown Online. It was released as free software in 2002. Carnegie Mellon University's Entertainment Technology Center, which currently hosts the website and other Panda3D services, was actively involved in the development of Panda3D into an open source project. It is now developed jointly by Disney and contributors from around the world.\n\nYou can read more about Panda3D's features.\n\nPanda3D is not a Beginner's Tool or a Toy\n\nTo successfully use Panda3D, you must be a skilled programmer. If you do not know what an \"API\" is, or if you don't know what a \"tree\" is, you will probably find Panda3D overwhelming. This is no point-and-click game-maker: this is a tool for professionals. While it is important to point that out so you have accurate expectations, it's also relevant to be aware that Panda3D is one of the easiest and most powerful engines you will ever use, and we welcome your participation.",
