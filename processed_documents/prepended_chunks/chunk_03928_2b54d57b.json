  "content": "This chunk is part of a method responsible for aggregating and logging performance profiles at specific intervals. It iterates through predefined logging periods, checks if it's time to log, and then merges the aggregated data into longer-term profiles. This process ensures that profiling results are systematically logged and consolidated over increasing time spans without overwhelming the system with excessive logs per frame.\n\n# log profiles when it's time, and aggregate them upwards into the\n        # next-longer profile\n        for pi in range(len(self._logSchedule)):\n            period = self._logSchedule[pi]\n            if (self._timeElapsed % period) == 0:\n                if period in p2ap:\n                    # delay until the next frame if we've already processed N profiles this frame\n                    if counter >= 3:\n                        counter = 0\n                        yield Task.cont\n                    self.notify.info('aggregate profile of sampled frames over last %s\\n%s' %\n                                     (formatTimeExact(period), p2ap[period].getResults()))\n                    counter += 1\n                    # aggregate this profile into the next larger profile\n                    nextIndex = pi + 1\n                    if nextIndex >= len(self._logSchedule):\n                        # if we're adding a new period to the end of the log period table,",
