  "content": "DirectScrolledFrame is a specialized GUI element that allows users to navigate larger content through scrolling within an on-screen window. The scroll bars are automatically created and hidden based on whether the virtual canvas size exceeds the visible frame size, with options to customize their behavior using manageScrollBars and autoHideScrollBars parameters.\n\nBy default, the scroll bars are automatically created with the DirectScrolledFrame and will be hidden automatically when they are not needed (that is, if the virtual frame size is equal to or smaller than the onscreen frame size). You can adjust either frame size at runtime and the scroll bars will automatically adjust as needed. If you would prefer to manage the scroll bars yourself, you can set one or both of manageScrollBars and autoHideScrollBars to False.",
