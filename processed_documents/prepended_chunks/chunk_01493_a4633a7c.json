The code adjusts the vertical position (`newpos[2]`) based on whether the indicator is placed 'above' or 'below' its associated element, taking into account border widths and size differences between the bounding boxes of the main component and the indicator.\n\nnewpos[2] += bbounds[3]-lbounds[3] - self['boxBorder'] - ibw[1]\n            else:                                      #below\n                newpos[2] += bbounds[2]-lbounds[2] + self['boxBorder'] + ibw[1]",
