  "content": "The chunk is part of a garbage detection system designed to identify and log memory leaks in Python applications, particularly useful in environments where preventing memory leaks is critical for performance. The function `b_ checkForGarbageLeaks` serves as a utility to trigger garbage collection checks on both the client and server (AI) sides of an application, ensuring comprehensive leak detection and reporting. It leverages logging and configuration settings to manage how leaks are handled, making it a key component in maintaining application health by detecting and addressing memory issues efficiently.\n\n```plaintext\nThe function `b_ checkForGarbageLeaks` is part of a garbage detection system that checks for memory leaks in Python applications.
