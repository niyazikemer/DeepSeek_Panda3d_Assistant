  "content": "This chunk is situated within the section discussing strategies to limit graphics memory usage in Panda applications, emphasizing the impracticality of dynamically determining hardware limits and the importance of user-adjustable defaults. It also introduces the use of PStats for monitoring actual graphics memory consumption, providing insights into active and inactive textures as well as buffer memory.\n\nIdeally, it would be great to query the amount of useful graphics memory provided by the card, and set this as the graphics-memory-limit; unfortunately, this is impractical for several reasons, including the reasons given above. Typically, if you wish your application to work on a variety of hardware, you will need to come up with a handful of default settings and allow the user to select between them, according to his own knowledge of his hardware capabilities.\n\nMonitoring memory usage\n\nYou can see how much graphics memory you are actually consuming with the PStats <measuring-performance-with-pstats> tool. Select the \"Graphics memory\" option. This graph will show the amount of memory required for active (onscreen), and inactive (offscreen) textures. It also includes memory required for vertex and index buffers, though these are typically much smaller than your texture memory requirements.",
