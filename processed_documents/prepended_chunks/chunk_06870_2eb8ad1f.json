  "content": "The setting describes configuration variables related to vertex buffers and column alignment in OpenGL rendering, affecting performance optimization.\n\nthe setting of the vertex-buffers variable (since vertex buffers are a\nspecial case of vertex arrays in OpenGL). This variable is normally not\nenabled in a production build. This has no effect on DirectX\nrendering. vertex-buffers bool 1 Set this true to allow the use of vertex buffers (or buffer objects,\nas OpenGL dubs them) for rendering vertex data. This can greatly improve\nrendering performance on higher-end graphics cards, at the cost of some\nadditional graphics memory (which might otherwise be used for textures\nor offscreen buffers). On lower-end graphics cards this will make little\nor no difference. vertex-column-alignment int 4 This specifies the default byte alignment for each column of data\nwithin a GeomVertexData when it is assembled using the default\ninterfaces. Normally, you should not change this config variable (which\nwould change this value globally), but instead specify any alignment\nrequirements on a per-column basis as you construct a GeomVertexFormat.",
