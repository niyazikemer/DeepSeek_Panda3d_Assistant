  "content": "The chunk introduces the concept of Texture Combine Modes as part of a document describing advanced texture blending options in a graphics system. It explains that these combine modes provide more flexibility than basic blend modes by allowing specific sources to be specified for operations on RGB and alpha channels. The chunk specifically focuses on explaining the RGB modes, starting with the `setCombineRgb` method for the replace mode (`CMReplace`).\n\nTexture Combine Modes\n\nIn addition to the several Texture Blend Modes <texture-modes> described previously, there is a more advanced interface on TextureStage that allows for a larger vocabulary of texture blending options.\n\nAlthough several of the following options (CMReplace, CMModulate, CMAdd) have obvious parallels with the simpler blend modes described previously, they are in fact more powerful, because with each of the following you may specify the particular source or sources to be used for the operation; you are not limited to simply applying the operation to the top texture and the texture below.\n\nRGB modes\n\nThe following specify the effect of the RGB (color) channels. A separate set of methods, below, specifies the effect of the alpha channel.\n\npython\n\nts.setCombineRgb(TextureStage.CMReplace, source, operand)\n\ncpp\n\nts->set_combine_rgb(TextureStage::CM_replace, source, operand);",
