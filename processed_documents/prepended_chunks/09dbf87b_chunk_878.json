  "content": "The provided code is part of a system for managing particle effects and their associated forces. The chunk contains functions related to updating force widgets and adding specific types of linear forces (vector, friction, jitter) to a particle effect's force group. These commands are used to modify the behavior of particle effects by adjusting the forces acting upon them.\n\nThis code is situated within a class that manages particle effects, their properties, and associated forces. The `updateForceWidgets` function updates the UI elements related to the selected force group, while the other functions (`addLinearVectorForce`, etc.) create new instances of specific force types and add them to the current force group. These commands are essential for configuring how particles behave under various physical effects.\n\nThe overall codebase appears to be part of a particle effect editing tool or simulation system, where users can define and modify forces acting on particles to achieve desired visual or mechanical behaviors.\n\n## FORCEGROUP COMMANDS ##\n    def updateForceWidgets(self):\n        # Select appropriate notebook page\n        if self.forceGroup is not None:\n            self.forceGroupNotebook.pack(fill = tk.X)\n            self.forcePageName = (self.particleEffect.getName() + '-' +\n                                  self.forceGroup.getName())\n            self.forcePage = self.forcePagesDict.get(\n                self.forcePageName, None)\n            # Page doesn't exist, add it\n            if self.forcePage is None:\n                self.addForceGroupNotebookPage(\n                    self.particleEffect, self.forceGroup)\n            self.forceGroupNotebook.selectpage(self.forcePageName)\n        else:\n            self.forceGroupNotebook.pack_forget()\n\n    def addLinearVectorForce(self):\n        self.addForce(LinearVectorForce())\n\n    def addLinearFrictionForce(self):\n        self.addForce(LinearFrictionForce())\n\n    def addLinearJitterForce(self):\n        self.addForce(LinearJitterForce())",
