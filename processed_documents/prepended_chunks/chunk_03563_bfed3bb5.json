  "content": "This chunk is part of an `EntryScale` class that manages user input values in a GUI application. The `get()` method returns the current value, while `set()` updates it after clamping and rounding, then updates UI elements like scales and entries, and executes associated commands. These methods are crucial for handling data constraints and triggering actions based on user input within the application's interface.\n\ndef get(self):\n        return self.value\n\n    def set(self, newVal, fCommand = 1):\n        # Clamp value\n        if self['min'] is not None:\n            if newVal < self['min']:\n                newVal = self['min']\n        if self['max'] is not None:\n            if newVal > self['max']:\n                newVal = self['max']\n        # Round by resolution\n        if self['resolution'] is not None:\n            newVal = round(newVal / self['resolution']) * self['resolution']\n\n        # Record updated value\n        self.value = newVal\n        # Update scale's position\n        self.scale.set(newVal)\n        # Update entry to reflect formatted value\n        self.entryValue.set(self.entryFormat % self.value)\n        self.entry.checkentry()\n\n        # execute command\n        if fCommand and (self['command'] is not None):\n            self['command'](newVal)\n\n    def onReturn(self, *args):\n        \"\"\" User redefinable callback executed on <Return> in entry \"\"\"",
