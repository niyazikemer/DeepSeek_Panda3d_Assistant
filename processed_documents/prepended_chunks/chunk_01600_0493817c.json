It checks if all items provided are strings and makes a copy to prevent modifying the original list. This setup occurs during object creation when handling initial parameters.\n\n**Context:** The chunk initializes the scroll list, ensuring that item modifications don't affect user data by copying string lists and setting up tracking with `nextItemID`.\n\n# if 'items' is a list of strings, make a copy for our use\n        # so we can modify it without mangling the user's list\n        if 'items' in kw:\n            for item in kw['items']:\n                if not isinstance(item, str):\n                    break\n            else:\n                # we get here if every item in 'items' is a string\n                # make a copy\n                kw['items'] = kw['items'][:]\n\n        self.nextItemID = 10",
