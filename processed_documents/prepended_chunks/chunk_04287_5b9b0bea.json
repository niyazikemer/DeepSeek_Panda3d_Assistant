The chunk contains code related to handling fade effects, specifically setting the scale of a fade overlay and preparing an interval for a fade-in animation without starting it immediately. This functionality is particularly useful in contexts like cutscenes where precise control over transitions is necessary.\n\nThe context for the chunk involves methods that manage visual overlays (fade effects) and animations using intervals, allowing for controlled execution and integration with other processes.\n\nself.fade.setScale(max(base.a2dRight, base.a2dTop))\n\n    def getFadeInIval(self, t=0.5, finishIval=None, blendType='noBlend'):\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns an interval without starting it.
