  "content": "The `GeomVertexFormat` describes the structure of vertex data arrays, including their columns and properties. The chunk discusses additional properties of `GeomVertexColumn`, such as offset and byte-alignment, which are typically handled automatically but may require attention for custom data formats. See the auto-generated API documentation for further details.\n\nThere are also additional properties associated with each GeomVertexColumn that determine its exact offset and byte-alignment within each row of the array, but normally you do not need to worry about these, unless you are designing a GeomVertexFormat that matches some already-existing block of data. See the auto-generated API specification for more details.",
