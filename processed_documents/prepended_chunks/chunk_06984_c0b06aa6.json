  "content": "The chunk appears within a section of the document that provides learning resources for programming with Panda3D using both Python and C++. The first part of the chunk lists Python programming resources, including links from the official Python website and other recommended tutorials. The second part introduces learning C++, explaining that while most documentation uses Python, function calls are similar in C++ and providing links to C++ tutorials.\n\nPython Programming Resources\n\nThere are a lot of other resources available for programming in Python. Here is a list of some of the best:\n\nLinks from the official Python website:\n\nOfficial Website - https://www.python.org\n\nCurrent Python Documentation\n\nPython Documentation\n\nHere are some other good links for learning Python:\n\nByte of Python\n\nDive Into Python\n\nBeginner's Guide from Python's wiki\n\ncpp\n\nLearning C++\n\nIt is possible to write Panda3D programs using C++. However, since most of the documentation uses Python, it may be better to learn Panda3D using Python first, and then switch to C++ later. If you do switch, the function calls are very similar.\n\nC++ is an object-oriented high-level multi-purpose language. It is actually a copy of the C programming language, but object-oriented, with more functions. Here are a few links to C++ tutorials that might be useful for you:\n\nhttp://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/\n\nwww.learncpp.com",
