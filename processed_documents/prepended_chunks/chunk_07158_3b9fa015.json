  "content": "The chunk introduces the concept of clearing DisplayRegions in a window with multiple regions, explaining what clearing entails and why it's essential to perform it at each frame. It discusses the default behavior where the entire window is cleared once for efficiency, particularly when regions don't overlap and share the same background color. This section sets the stage for understanding more complex scenarios involving overlapping regions or varying background colors.\n\nContext:\n\"\"\"Introduction to clearing DisplayRegions in a window with multiple regions. Explains the importance of performing clears at each frame and the default behavior of clearing the entire window once for efficiency, especially when regions don't overlap and share the same background color.\"\"\"\nThis introductory section provides foundational knowledge about display region clearing before delving into more detailed topics such as overlapping regions or different background colors.\n\nClearing Display Regions\n\nWhen you have more than one DisplayRegion in a particular window, it is important to consider which of them, if any, you want to perform an explicit clear operation before drawing.\n\nClearing means to erase the contents of the window or DisplayRegion, and set it all to the background color. Normally, you should perform a clear at the beginning of every frame, or you will be drawing the new frame on top of the contents of the previous frame.\n\nThe default is for clear to be performed by the GraphicsOutput (the window or buffer), before any DisplayRegions are drawn at all. This is usually the best way to clear the window, because it is slightly faster to perform one big clear operation that resets the whole window at once, rather than clearing each DisplayRegion individually. This particularly makes sense when your DisplayRegions don't overlap, and they all want to have the same background color, like this:",
