  "content": "The `exit()` method is designed for a class managing multiple server connections. It sends an exit command to each server and terminates the local process.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Class**: The `exit()` method should be added to a class that has a `serverList` attribute, such as `ClusterClient` or `ClusterClientSync`.\n\n2. **Method Implementation**: Define the `exit()` method within this class to iterate over each server in `self.serverList`, sending an exit command.\n\n3. **Local Exit**: After handling remote servers, import `sys` and call `sys.exit()` to terminate the local process.\n\n**Code Integration:**\n\n```python\nclass ClusterClient:\n    # existing methods...\n\n    def exit(self):\n        # Execute remotely on each server\n        for server in self.serverList:\n            server.send_exit_command()\n        # Exit locally\n        import sys\n        sys.exit()\n```\n\nThis method ensures proper shutdown of all managed servers and the local process.\n\ndef exit(self):\n        # Execute remotely\n        for server in self.serverList:\n            server.sendExit()\n        # Execute locally\n        import sys\n        sys.exit()",
