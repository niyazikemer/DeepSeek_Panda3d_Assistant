  "content": "This code snippet demonstrates how to set up an orthographic lens in C++, including specifying its film size and adjusting near/far clipping planes. It also highlights the nonintuitive behavior of orthographic projection where object scaling with distance is absent, making camera movement difficult to perceive.\n\ncpp\n\nPT(OrthographicLens) lens = new OrthographicLens();\nlens->set_film_size(20, 15); // Or whatever is appropriate for your scene\nwindow->get_camera(0)->set_lens(lens);\n\nNote that using an orthographic lens can be nonintuitive at times--for instance, objects don't get larger as you come closer to them, and they don't get smaller as you get farther away--so it may be impossible to tell your camera is even moving!",
