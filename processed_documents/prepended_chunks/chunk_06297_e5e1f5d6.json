  "content": "This chunk provides step-by-step instructions on exporting a model using MayaPandaTool within Maya, detailing how to save an egg file, select the Maya .mb file, choose the Maya version, and decide between static geometry or animation. It fits into a section explaining how to utilize the graphical front-end tool for efficient model exportation from Maya. The surrounding context includes setup steps for integrating MayaPandaTool into Maya's interface, allowing users to quickly access the exporter through the shelf or script editor. This makes it easier for artists to transition their models into Panda3D projects by providing a user-friendly method with options tailored to different project needs, such as static props or animated characters.\n\n**Context:** Using the MayaPandaTool graphical interface simplifies the process of exporting 3D models from Maya. The tool offers straightforward steps for saving egg files, selecting source .mb files, choosing Maya versions, and deciding between static geometry or animation exports, streamlining asset preparation for Panda3D projects.\n\nClick the Save button next to the first text box labeled \u201cEgg file to be written\u201d and navigate to your intended export directory and name your file. When you\u2019ve finished this, click OK.\n\nClick the Choose button next to the text box labeled \u201cMaya file to be exported\u201d and select the .mb file that you would like to export.\n\nSelect the version of Maya you currently have on your system from the Maya Version drop-down box.\n\nNow, before you click Run Export, you must decide if you want to export any animation from the file and if so what type. If you simply want a static model (usually used for props and game levels) select \u201cnone\u201d in the Animation box. This will export only the geometry from your scene, excluding any joints or key frames. It should be noted that this type of model will not export any skinning data from Maya. However, it will still have a transform included which will allow it to be placed in a Panda3D world.",
