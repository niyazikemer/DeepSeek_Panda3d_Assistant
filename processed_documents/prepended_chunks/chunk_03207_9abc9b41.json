  "content": "The provided code snippet appears to be part of a larger system for selecting and manipulating 3D objects in a graphical environment, possibly using Panda3D or a similar library. The code is handling selection logic where it iterates over a list of selected nodes (`selectionList`), selects each node, checks for geometric intersections with a raycaster (`direct.iRay`), records hit points, updates the selection state based on user input flags (`direct.fShift`), and cleans up any manipulation operations when done. This chunk is likely part of an event handler or mouse/keyboard interaction system responsible for selecting objects in a 3D scene. The code also includes logic to handle deselection if no valid intersection is found, ensuring the state remains consistent.\n\nDoc String Context:\n\"\"\"\nThis section manages object selection and manipulation within a 3D environment.\nIt handles node selection, hit point recording, and cleanup operations during interaction.\n\"\"\"\n\nfor nodePath in selectionList:\n                    direct.select(nodePath, 1)\n\n            else:\n                entry = direct.iRay.pickGeom(skipFlags = skipFlags)\n                if entry:\n                    # Record hit point information\n                    self.hitPt.assign(entry.getSurfacePoint(entry.getFromNodePath()))\n                    self.hitPtDist = Vec3(self.hitPt).length()\n                    # Select it\n                    direct.select(entry.getIntoNodePath(), direct.fShift)\n                else:\n                    direct.deselectAll()\n        #elif self.mode == 'move':\n        self.manipulateObjectCleanup()\n\n        self.mode = None",
