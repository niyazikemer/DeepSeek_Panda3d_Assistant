  "content": "The provided document is a comprehensive guide detailing third-party dependencies and their associated licenses for Panda3D, along with usage notes, recommendations, and considerations for developers. The chunk situates itself as an introductory section, providing context on the licensing framework of Panda3D, legal disclaimers, and guidance for building the software while managing external libraries.\n\nThird-party dependencies and license info\n\nLicense Info\n\nWhile Panda3D itself uses the Modified BSD license, it brings together many third-party libraries released under different licenses. This page provides information on the different libraries and their licenses. Panda3D builds with some of these libraries by default, however, some of them are linked only into plug-ins that can be easily removed from the distribution.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPanda3D takes no responsibility for any act committed using the information presented here. For legal advice, it is recommended to consult a lawyer.\n\nBuilding Panda3D\n\nWhen building Panda3D yourself on your computer you'll notice that makepanda.py looks up if you have some libraries installed. On operating systems with a packaging system, like most GNU/Linux distros have, you'll most likely find all dependencies as packages in the official repositories. Otherwise you have to take care of the libraries yourself.",
