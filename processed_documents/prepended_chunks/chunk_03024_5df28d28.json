  "content": "The provided chunk consists of import statements at the beginning of a Python script that implements a texture viewing utility. The imports bring in essential Panda3D core components like CardMaker for creating 2D cards, LineSegs for drawing lines, TextNode for text rendering, Texture for handling textures, and TransparencyAttrib for managing transparency settings. Additionally, it imports DirectObject from the DirectShowbase framework for event handling and ShowBaseGlobal for accessing global scene graphs. These imports are foundational to the implementation of a texture viewer class named TexViewer, which displays both full-resolution and reduced-resolution versions of a given texture on screen.\n\nfrom panda3d.core import CardMaker, LineSegs, TextNode, Texture, TransparencyAttrib\nfrom direct.showbase.DirectObject import DirectObject\nfrom direct.showbase import ShowBaseGlobal",
