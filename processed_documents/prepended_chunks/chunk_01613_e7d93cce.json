This functionality is part of the method that manages item visibility, positioning, and callback execution during scrolling operations. The code adjusts the position of visible items based on their index relative to the currently selected item (`self.index`) and triggers any defined command with associated arguments after updating the display.\n\nitem.show()\n            item.setPos(0, 0,  -(i-self.index) * self.maxHeight)\n            #print 'height bug tracker: i-%s idx-%s h-%s' % (i, self.index, self.maxHeight)\n\n        if self['command']:\n            # Pass any extra args to command\n            self['command'](*self['extraArgs'])\n        return ret",
