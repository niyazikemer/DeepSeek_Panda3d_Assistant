  "content": "This chunk describes the setup of tasks for polling network handlers (specifically the connection listener) in a Panda3D client-server application. It occurs during the server initialization phase, after opening a TCP socket and adding it to the listener, but before handling incoming connections. The code ensures that the server actively monitors for new client connections by periodically checking the listener state through task callbacks.\n\ncListener.addConnection(tcpSocket)\n\nSince the network handlers we instantiated are polled, we'll create some tasks to do the polling.\n\ntaskMgr.add(tskListenerPolling, \"Poll the connection listener\", -39)\ntaskMgr.add(tskReaderPolling, \"Poll the connection reader\", -40)\n\nWhen a connection comes in, the tskListenerPolling function below handles the incoming connection and hands it to the QueuedConnectionReader. The connection is now established.\n\nfrom panda3d.core import PointerToConnection\nfrom panda3d.core import NetAddress\n\ndef tskListenerPolling(taskdata):\n    if cListener.newConnectionAvailable():\n\n        rendezvous = PointerToConnection()\n        netAddress = NetAddress()\n        newConnection = PointerToConnection()",
