  "content": "The provided code chunk implements the `updateCurve` function within an object editor, which modifies the degree and control points of a 3D curve object. This function retrieves the current curve information from the object's properties, constructs a new list of curve points, and updates the curve using its `setup` method with the specified degree and points.\n\nContext: Object Editor Curve Update Functionality\n\nThe code chunk is part of an object editor system responsible for modifying 3D curve objects. The function `updateCurve` adjusts the curve's properties based on user input or programmatic changes, ensuring that these modifications are tracked by the editor's action management system for potential undo/redo operations.\n\n```python\ndef updateCurve(self, val, obj):\n    # Update a 3D curve object with new degree and control points.\n    curve = obj[OG.OBJ_NP]\n    degree = int(val)\n    curveNode = obj[OG.OBJ_PROP]['curveInfo']\n    curveInfor = []\n    for item in curveNode:\n        curveInfor.append((None, item[1].getPos()))\n    curve.setup(degree, curveInfor)\n```\n\nThis function is used to update the properties of a 3D curve object in response to changes made during editing.\n\n# finally call update function\n                #func(**kwargs)\n        else:\n            oldVal = objProp[propName]\n            func = None\n            undoFunc = None\n        action = ActionUpdateObjectProp(self.editor, fSelectObject, obj, propName, val, oldVal, func, undoFunc)\n        if fUndo:\n            self.editor.actionMgr.push(action)\n        action()\n\n        if self.editor:\n            self.editor.fNeedToSave = True\n            if fSelectObject:\n                base.direct.select(obj[OG.OBJ_NP], fUndo=0)\n\n    def updateCurve(self, val, obj):\n        curve = obj[OG.OBJ_NP]\n        degree = int(val)\n        curveNode = obj[OG.OBJ_PROP]['curveInfo']\n        curveInfor = []\n        for item in curveNode:\n            curveInfor.append((None, item[1].getPos()))\n        curve.setup(degree, curveInfor)",
