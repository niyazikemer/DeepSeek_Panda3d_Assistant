  "content": "This chunk is part of a comprehensive catalogue of sample programs included in the Panda3D distribution. Each program demonstrates specific features of the engine, ranging from advanced shader effects (e.g., `fireflies` with deferred shading) to practical applications like loading media (`media-player`) or creating particle systems (`particles`). The samples vary in difficulty, providing examples for both beginners and advanced users to explore and learn different aspects of Panda3D.\n\nfireflies\n\nDifficulty: Very Advanced\n\nDeferred shading - a complex shader-based algorithm\n\nfractal-plants\n\nDifficulty: Very Advanced\n\nCreates a 3D model without loading it from disk\n\nglow-filter\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate (or Advanced)\n\nEnabling per-pixel lighting\n\nExplicit Shaders\n\nImage Postprocessing\n\nRender-to-Texture\n\ninfinite-tunnel\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nUsing fog to hide artifacts in the distance\n\nlooking-and-gripping\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nControlling a character's head procedurally\n\nCausing a character to grip an object\n\nmedia-player\n\nDifficulty: Beginner\n\nLoading a texture from an AVI file\n\nLoading a sound from an AVI file\n\nSynchronizing audio and video\n\nmotion-trails\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate (or Advanced)\n\nCreating a trail behind a moving object.\n\nCaptures contents of screen and reuses it later.\n\nmusic-box\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nPlaying sounds\n\nGUI buttons and sliders\n\nparticles\n\nDifficulty: Advanced\n\nDemonstrates the particle system\n\nprocedural-cube",
