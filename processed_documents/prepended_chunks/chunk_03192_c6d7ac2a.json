  "content": "This code chunk introduces new flags for enabling specific selection modes (allowing only selection while other manipulations are disabled), marquee selection support, multi-view functionality, and grid snapping. It also includes methods to scale widgets and handle multi-view support in the DirectManipulation class. These additions enhance the interactivity and usability of the manipulation tools by providing more flexible selection options and better visual representation across different views.\n\n# [gjeon] flag to enable selection while other manipulation is disabled\n        self.fAllowSelectionOnly = 0\n\n        # [gjeon] flag to enable marquee selection feature\n        self.fAllowMarquee = 0\n        self.marquee = None\n\n        # [gjeon] for new LE's multi-view support\n        self.fMultiView = 0\n\n        # [gjeon] to support grid snapping\n        self.fGridSnap = 0\n\n    def scaleWidget(self, factor):\n        if hasattr(ShowBaseGlobal.direct, 'widget'):\n            ShowBaseGlobal.direct.widget.multiplyScalingFactorBy(factor)\n        else:\n            self.objectHandles.multiplyScalingFactorBy(factor)\n\n    def supportMultiView(self):\n        if self.fMultiView:\n            return\n\n        self.objectHandles.hide(BitMask32.bit(0))\n        self.objectHandles.hide(BitMask32.bit(1))\n        self.objectHandles.hide(BitMask32.bit(2))",
