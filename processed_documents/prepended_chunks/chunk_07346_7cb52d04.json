  "content": "This chunk is part of a discussion about optimizing performance in 3D rendering by reducing polygon counts and improving GPU efficiency. Specifically, it addresses hardware skinning optimizations for vertex animations and techniques to lower the rendering load by adjusting camera parameters.\n\nhardware-animated-vertices true\nbasic-shaders-only false\n\nFor this to work, you will need to have a shader applied that supports hardware skinning, or you need to have the-shader-generator enabled. Otherwise, Panda will silently continue to perform the animation on the CPU.\n\nSee if you can lower the far distance or far plane <lenses-and-field-of-view> of the camera lens. Anything farther than the far plane of the camera lens won't be rendered. You can use fog <fog> to hide the clipping.",
