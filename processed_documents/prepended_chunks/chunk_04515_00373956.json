  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a memory leak detection mechanism in an application. The `LeakDetector` class schedules periodic checks to detect potential memory leaks by tracking changes in the size of objects (containers) over time. The specific code snippet compares the size of containers at different intervals, identifies significant growth which could indicate a leak, and attempts to retrieve details about those containers for reporting.\n\nif objId in idx2id2len[self._index-1]:\n                        diff = idx2id2len[self._index][objId] - idx2id2len[self._index-1][objId]\n                        \"\"\"\n                        # this check is too spammy\n                        if diff > 20:\n                            if diff > idx2id2len[self._index-1][objId]:\n                                minutes = (self._leakDetector._index2delay[self._index] -\n                                           self._leakDetector._index2delay[self._index-1]) / 60.\n                                name = self._leakDetector.getContainerNameById(objId)\n                                if idx2id2len[self._index-1][objId] != 0:\n                                    percent = 100. * (float(diff) / float(idx2id2len[self._index-1][objId]))\n                                    try:\n                                        for container in self._leakDetector.getContainerByIdGen(objId):",
