  "content": "The chunk describes the usage of PointerTo in Panda3D's reference counting system, specifically using PT(TextNode) as an example. It explains how PointerTo works similarly to regular pointers but with added safety features and discusses scenarios where it may not be necessary for efficiency.\n\nThere is also a macro ConstPointerTo<T>, shortened to CPT(T), which manages a pointer to a const object. This is similar to const T* in C++; the pointer can still be reassigned, but the object may not be modified.\n\nThis is a usage example:\n\nPT(TextNode) node = new TextNode(\"title\");\n\nnode->set_text(\"I am a reference counted TextNode!\");\n\nA PointerTo is functionally equivalent to a regular pointer, and it can cast implicitly to the appropriate pointer type. You can use ptr.p() to explicitly retrieve the underlying plain pointer.\n\nWhen they aren't necessary\n\nAlthough it is safest to use PT(T) to refer to an object in all cases, in some cases it is not strictly necessary and may be more efficient not to.",
