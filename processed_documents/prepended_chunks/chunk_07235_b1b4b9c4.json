  "content": "This code chunk is part of a section explaining how to handle client-server synchronization in a distributed system using a Client Repository. The methods `syncReady` and `gotCreateReady` are critical for ensuring the client is properly synchronized with the server's TimeManager and has the authority to create valid Distributed Objects (DOs) before proceeding with further operations. This step is essential for maintaining consistency across clients and servers in distributed environments.\n\nThe context involves setting up a connection to a server, synchronizing time, and verifying that the client can correctly create objects with valid identifiers. The use of `uniqueName` ensures that messages are correctly routed without interference from other clients. Once synchronization is confirmed and authority is established, the client can proceed to create DOs and manage their interactions within defined zones.\n\nThis section emphasizes the importance of proper initialization and synchronization steps in distributed systems, ensuring that all clients operate consistently with the server's state before engaging in more complex operations.\n\n# We must wait for the TimeManager to be fully created and\n        # synced before we can enter another zone and wait for the\n        # game object.  The uniqueName is important that we get the\n        # correct, our sync message from the TimeManager and not\n        # accidentally a message from another client\n        self.acceptOnce(self.uniqueName('gotTimeSync'), self.syncReady)\n\n    def syncReady(self):\n        \"\"\" Now we've got the TimeManager manifested, and we're in\n        sync with the server time.  Now we can enter the world.  Check\n        to see if we've received our doIdBase yet. \"\"\"\n\n        # This method checks whether we actually have a valid doID range\n        # to create distributed objects yet\n        if self.haveCreateAuthority():\n            # we already have one\n            self.gotCreateReady()\n        else:\n            # Not yet, keep waiting a bit longer.\n            self.accept(self.uniqueName('createReady'), self.gotCreateReady)",
