  "content": "The provided chunk introduces the tools and features related to converting Blender models into formats compatible with Panda3D, specifically highlighting `blend2bam` as a primary recommendation for users aiming to integrate their Blender models seamlessly into Panda3D projects.\n\nPlease note that some of these tools rely on features that were introduced in Panda3D 1.10.8, so please make sure you are using the latest stable version of Panda3D.\n\nOption 1: blend2bam\n\nBlend2bam is a command-line utility that converts .blend files into .bam files, which can be directly loaded into Panda3D. It does not do the conversion on its own, but interfaces with other exporters and converters (which may differ depending on your version of Blender) and sets them up with the right settings to get the correct result in Panda3D. It also adds a few extensions on top of the glTF conversion to add support for collision shapes. As such, it is considered the most fool-proof option for getting Blender models into Panda3D.\n\nYou can simply add this to your Panda3D installation using pip:\n\npython -m pip install -U panda3d-blend2bam\n\nTo convert a model, enter the blend2bam command on the command-line:\n\nblend2bam myfile.blend myfile.bam",
