  "content": "This chunk describes an example of creating a DGameObject client-side using its class name from DC definition files, setting its zoneId to 2, explaining how clients with interest in that zone will see the object, and noting further details about distributed objects will follow.\n\nThis example creates a DGameObject only from the name as defined in the DC definition files.\n\nself.gameDistObject = self.createDistributedObject(\n    className = 'DGameObject',\n    zoneId = 2)\n\nAs you have seen we\u2019ve set the zoneId to 2. This tells the object to live in this specific zone and all clients that have defined an interest in this zone with .ClientRepository.setInterestZones() will automatically \u201csee\u201d this object.\n\nFurther details about distributed objects and their usage will be shown in later sections.",
