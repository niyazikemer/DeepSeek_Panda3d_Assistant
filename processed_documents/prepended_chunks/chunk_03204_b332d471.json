  "content": "The chunk appears within a method that iterates over geometries using `traverse()`, finds their corresponding node paths, checks if they are already selected, and processes their bounding boxes by transforming them into global space. The purpose is to handle spatial queries or transformations for rendering or selection purposes in a 3D scene graph traversal process.\n\n```python\ndef findTaggedNodePath(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Traverse geometries, check against the selection list, and transform bounds.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ... rest of the code ...\n```\n\nThis succinct docstring captures the context without going into implementation details while improving searchability.\n\nnodePath = findTaggedNodePath(geom)\n                    if nodePath in selectionList:\n                        continue\n\n                    bb = geom.getBounds()\n                    bbc = bb.makeCopy()\n                    bbc.xform(geom.getParent().getNetTransform().getMat())",
