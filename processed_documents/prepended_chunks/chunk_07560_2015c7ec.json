  "content": "This chunk describes how to efficiently add multiple vertices at once when creating GeomPrimitive objects in Panda3D, specifically using the `add_vertices()` method. It also discusses the important concept of **usage hints** (`UHStatic` or `UHDynamic`) when constructing a GeomPrimitive, which affect performance optimization but do not restrict functionality.\n\n// you can also add a few at once\nprim->add_vertices(2, 1, 3);\n\nprim->add_vertices(0, 5, 6);\n\nNote that the GeomPrimitive constructor requires one parameter, which is a usage hint, similar to the usage hint required for the geomvertexdata constructor. Like that usage hint, this tells Panda whether you will frequently adjust the vertex indices on this primitive after it has been created. Since it is very unusual to adjust the vertex indices on a primitive (usually, if you intend to animate the vertices, you would operate on the vertices, not these indices), this is almost always Geom.UH_static, even if the primitive is associated with a dynamic GeomVertexData. However, there may be special rendering effects in which you actually do manipulate this vertex index table in-place every few frames, in which case you should use Geom.UHDynamic. As with the GeomVertexData, this is only a performance hint; you're not required to adhere to the usage you specify.",
