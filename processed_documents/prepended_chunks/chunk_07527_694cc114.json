  "content": "The section discusses various render effects like BillboardEffect and their immediate application in scene graphs, contrasting with Render_attrib's propagation behavior, and guides on creating/modifying effects through specific make() methods.\n\nRender Effects\n\nThere are a number of special render effects that may be set on scene graph nodes to change the way they render. This includes BillboardEffect, Compass Effect, DecalEffect, PolylightEffect, and ShowBoundsEffect.\n\nList of All Render Effects:\n\nRenderEffect represents render properties that must be applied as soon as they are encountered in the scene graph, rather than propagating down to the leaves. This is different from RenderAttrib, which represents properties like color and texture that don't do anything until they propagate down to a GeomNode.\n\nYou should not attempt to create or modify a RenderEffect directly; instead, use the make() method of the appropriate kind of effect you want. This will allocate and return a new RenderEffect of the appropriate type, and it may share pointers if possible. Do not modify the new RenderEffect if you wish to change its properties; instead, create a new one.",
