  "content": "The provided text discusses the properties and usage of orthographic lenses in 3-D rendering, emphasizing their lack of perspective and the importance of setting film size in spatial units. The chunk specifically explains how to adjust an orthographic lens's view through film size settings rather than a field of view angle, using feet as units for spatial modeling.\n\nSince an orthographic lens doesn't have a field of view angle, the lens.set_fov() <.Lens.set_fov> method does nothing. To adjust the amount that the orthographic lens sees, you must adjust its film size. And unlike a .PerspectiveLens, the film size units are not arbitrary--for an .OrthographicLens, the film size should be specified in spatial units, the same units you used to model your scene. For instance, the film size of the .OrthographicLens in the above illustration was set with the call lens.set_film_size(20, 15) <.Lens.set_film_size>, which sets the film size to 20 feet by 15 feet--because the scene is modeled in feet, and the panda is about 12 feet tall.",
