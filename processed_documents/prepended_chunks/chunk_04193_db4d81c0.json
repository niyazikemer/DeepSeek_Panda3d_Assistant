  "content": "The given code chunk is situated within the `processEventPstats` method of the `EventManager` class. This method is responsible for handling C++ events while also collecting performance statistics to monitor event processing tasks. The specific lines initialize performance counters (pstatCollectors) for tracking both Python-side and, if applicable, C++-side event processing times.\n\n**Context:**  \nThe chunk initializes pstats collectors in the `processEventPstats` method, enabling performance monitoring of event handling tasks in both Python and C++.\n\npstatCollector = PStatCollector('App:Tasks:eventManager:' + name)\n            pstatCollector.start()\n            if self.eventHandler:\n                cppPstatCollector = PStatCollector(\n                    'App:Tasks:eventManager:' + name + ':C++')",
