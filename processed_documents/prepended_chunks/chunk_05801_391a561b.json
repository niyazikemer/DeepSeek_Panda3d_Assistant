  "content": "This section explains how to apply environment mapping techniques using sphere maps in Panda3D to create realistic shiny effects on 3D models. Specifically, it demonstrates how to use multitexturing with the Add mode to blend an existing texture (like a car's paint) with subtle reflective highlights without oversaturating colors by darkening the environment map beforehand.\n\ncar = loader.loadModel('bvw-f2004--carnsx/carnsx.egg')\ntex = loader.loadTexture('streetscene_env.jpg')\ncar.setTexGen(TextureStage.getDefault(), TexGenAttrib.MEyeSphereMap)\ncar.setTexture(tex, 1)\n\nThat looks pretty silly. So we'd really prefer to use multitexture <multitexture-introduction> to apply both the car's regular texture, and layer a little bit of shine on top of that. We'll use Add mode <texture-modes> to add the environment map to the existing color, which is appropriate for a shiny highlight on an object.\n\nIn order to use Add mode without oversaturating the colors, we need to darken the environment map substantially. We could use any image processing program to do this; for this example, we'll use Panda3D's image-trans utility:\n\nimage-trans -cscale 0.2 -o streetscene_env_dark.jpg streetscene_env.jpg\n\nSo the new map looks like this:",
