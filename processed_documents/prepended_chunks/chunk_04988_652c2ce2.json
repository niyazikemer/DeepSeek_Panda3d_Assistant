  "content": "The chunk describes the functionality for capturing screenshots in the application. It explains how filenames are handled when saving images and what types of sources can be used to capture screenshots.\n\n**Context:**\n\nThe following text describes how screenshots can be captured within the application, including details on filename handling and acceptable source types.\n\n```python\ndef takeScreenshot(self, defaultFilename=True, namePrefix=\"\", source=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Capture a screenshot from the specified source. If no source is provided,\n    it defaults to the main window.\n    \n    If defaultFilename is True, the filename uses a default suffix specified by\n    Config variable screenshot-filename. Otherwise, namePrefix is treated as\n    the full filename including extension.\n    \n    The source can be a GraphicsWindow, GraphicsBuffer, DisplayRegion, or\n    Texture. For cube map textures, ensure the name contains a '#' character.\n\n    :param bool defaultFilename: Determines if to use default filename suffix.\n    :param str namePrefix: Prefix for the screenshot filename.\n    :param source: The source from which to capture the screenshot.\n    :return: Success of the operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Implementation details here\n```\n\nIf defaultFilename is True, the filename is synthesized by\n        appending namePrefix to a default filename suffix (including\n        the filename extension) specified in the Config variable\n        screenshot-filename.  Otherwise, if defaultFilename is False,\n        the entire namePrefix is taken to be the filename to write,\n        and this string should include a suitable filename extension\n        that will be used to determine the type of image file to\n        write.\n\n        Normally, the source is a GraphicsWindow, GraphicsBuffer or\n        DisplayRegion.  If a Texture is supplied instead, it must have\n        a ram image (that is, if it was generated by\n        makeTextureBuffer() or makeCubeMap(), the parameter toRam\n        should have been set true).  If it is a cube map texture as\n        generated by makeCubeMap(), namePrefix should contain the hash\n        mark ('#') character.",
