  "content": "This chunk explains how to use ProjectileIntervals in Panda3D to move a NodePath along a trajectory under gravity. It provides an overview of the `ProjectileInterval` function, its parameters (e.g., `startPos`, `endPos`, `duration`, `startVel`, `endZ`, `gravityMult`), and examples of how to create intervals using different parameter combinations. The context is relevant for anyone working with physics-based motion, animation, or game development in Panda3D, focusing on simulating projectile trajectories with customizable parameters.\n\nProjectile Intervals\n\nProjectile intervals are used to move a NodePath through the trajectory of a projectile under the influence of gravity.\n\nmyInterval = ProjectileInterval(<Node Path>,\n    startPos=Point3(X, Y, Z), endPos=Point3(X, Y, Z),\n    duration=<Time in seconds>, startVel=Point3(X, Y, Z),\n    endZ=Z, gravityMult=<multiplier>, name=<Name>)\n\nAll parameters don't have to be specified. Here are a combination of parameters that will allow you to create a projectile interval. (If startPos is not provided, it will be obtained from the node's position at the time that the interval is first started. Note that in this case you must provide a duration.)\n\nstartPos, endPos, duration - go from startPos to endPos in duration seconds\n\nstartPos, startVel, duration - given a starting velocity, go for a specific time period\n\nstartPos, startVel, endZ - given a starting velocity, go until you hit a given Z plane",
