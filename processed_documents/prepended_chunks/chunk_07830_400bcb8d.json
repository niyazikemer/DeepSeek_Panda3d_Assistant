  "content": "The document explains how to configure TextNodes in Panda3D, covering aspects such as font selection, anti-aliasing effects, performance considerations, card creation, and text node picking. The chunk specifically addresses avoiding z-fighting between text and cards when rendering in 3D environments and provides workarounds for making TextNodes pickable by creating custom geometry or using decal effects.\n\nIf the text is to be visible in the 3-d world (that is, parented to render instead of to render2d), then you may observe z-fighting, or flashing, between the text and the card. To avoid this, call text.setCardDecal(True). This is not necessary when the text will be parented under render2d or aspect2d, or when you will be controlling the binning of the text explicitly.\n\nPicking a Text Node\n\nStrictly speaking, a TextNode has no geometry, so you can't pick it.\n\nThere are two possible workarounds.\n\nCreate your own card to go behind the TextNode, using e.g. CardMaker. You should be able to say cardMaker.setFrame(textNode.getFrameActual()) to set the card to be the same dimensions as the text's frame. Then you will need to either offset the text a few inches in front of the card to prevent Z-fighting, or explicitly decal the text onto the card, with something like this:\n\ncard = NodePath(cardMaker.generate())\ntnp = card.attachNewNode(textNode)\ncard.setEffect(DecalEffect.make())",
