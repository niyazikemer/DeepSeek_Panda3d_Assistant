  "content": "\"\"\"This section discusses using Panda3D's CompassEffect with caution for pos and scale modes, highlighting potential culling issues and suggesting bounding volume adjustments. It provides Python (`nodePath.setCompass()`) and C++ (`nodePath.set_compass();`) code examples to demonstrate how to apply the effect, including optional relative node path specifications.\"\"\"\n\nBe careful when using the pos and scale modes. In these modes, it's possible for the CompassEffect to move its node far from its normal bounding volume, causing culling to fail. If this is an issue, you may need to explicitly set a large (or infinite) bounding volume on the effect node.\n\npython\n\nnodePath.setCompass()\n\ncpp\n\nnodePath.set_compass();\n\nIf a .NodePath is supplied to the ~.NodePath.set_compass() call, it indicates the node to which the rotation will be kept relative (which is render by default).",
