  "content": "The chunk represents the initial documentation and setup of a Python module designed to manage global instances and variables within a Panda3D application, specifically handling ShowBase and related components.\n\n\"\"\"This module serves as a container to hold the global\n:class:`~.ShowBase.ShowBase` instance, as an alternative to using the builtin\nscope.\n\nMany of the variables contained in this module are also automatically written\nto the :mod:`builtins` module when ShowBase is instantiated, making them\navailable to any Python code.  Importing them from this module instead can make\nit easier to see where these variables are coming from.\n\nNote that you cannot directly import :data:`~builtins.base` from this module\nsince ShowBase may not have been created yet; instead, ShowBase dynamically\nadds itself to this module's scope when instantiated.\"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ()",
