  "content": "The chunk is the final code section in a Panda3D-based path following tutorial where an AI character moves along a predefined rectangular path in 3D space. It includes the task function `AIUpdate()` that continuously updates the AI world, and the lines `w = World()` and `base.run()`, which create the game world instance and start the application loop. This code is essential for initializing and running the AI behavior demonstration described earlier in the document.\n\ndef AIUpdate(self,task):\n        self.AIworld.update()\n        return Task.cont\n\nw = World()\nbase.run()\n\nTo get the full working demo, please visit:\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/etcpandai/documentation/steering-behaviors/path-follow/PandAIPathFollowTutorial.zip?attredirects=0&d=1",
