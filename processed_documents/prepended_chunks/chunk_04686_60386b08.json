  "content": "The chunk is part of a decorator function in a Python module focused on profiling and reporting utilities. This decorator customizes report generation by allowing parameters to control output formatting, data transformation, notification methods, and conditional logging based on configuration settings. It enhances functions with flexible logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring purposes.\n\n```context\nThe code is part of a decorator used within a profiling and reporting system. The decorator allows developers to customize how reports are generated by specifying options such as adding prefixes for easier identification, transforming input data, choosing notification methods (like info or warning), and controlling output based on specific configuration parameters.\n```\n\nprefix: Optional string to prepend to output, just before the\n            function.  Allows for easy grepping and is useful when\n            merging AI/Client reports into a single file.\n\n        xform:  Optional callback that accepts a single parameter:\n            argument 0 to the decorated function. (assumed to be 'self')\n            It should return a value to be inserted into the report\n            output string.\n\n        notifyFunc: A notify function such as info, debug, warning, etc.\n            By default the report will be printed to stdout. This will\n            allow you send the report to a designated 'notify' output.\n\n        dConfigParam: A list of Config.prc string variables.\n            By default the report will always print.  If you specify\n            this param, it will only print if one of the specified\n            config strings resolve to True.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def indent(str):\n        global __report_indent\n        return ' '*__report_indent+str",
