  "content": "This chunk appears in the section detailing how to configure and control a vehicle using Bullet in Panda3D. Specifically, it describes setting up wheel properties such as direction, axle orientation, radius, suspension parameters, damping, friction slip, and roll influence. The chunk transitions into controlling steering and engine/brake forces through input handling, defining steering angle limits, and specifying how forces are applied to the wheels.\n\nwheel.setWheelDirectionCs(Vec3(0, 0, -1))\nwheel.setWheelAxleCs(Vec3(1, 0, 0))\nwheel.setWheelRadius(0.25)\nwheel.setMaxSuspensionTravelCm(40.0)\n\nwheel.setSuspensionStiffness(40.0)\nwheel.setWheelsDampingRelaxation(2.3)\nwheel.setWheelsDampingCompression(4.4)\nwheel.setFrictionSlip(100.0)\nwheel.setRollInfluence(0.1)\n\nSteering and Engine/Brake\n\nFinally we need to control steering and engine/brakes. This is best done using a task, and keeping the current steering angle around somewhere in a variable.\n\nHere we use a very simple model of controlling the steering angle. If 'turnLeft' or 'turnRight' keys are pressed the steering angle will increase/decrease at a constant rate, until a maximum steering angle is achieved. No relaxation is applied. Therefor we also define constants for the maximum steering angle (here: steeringClamp) and the rate at which the steering angle increases/decreases (here: steeringIncrement).",
