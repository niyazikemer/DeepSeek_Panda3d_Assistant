  "content": "The chunk discusses the compatibility of Panda's matrix representation with OpenGL and DirectX, focusing on their shared storage format for derivatives wrt xi first, while highlighting differences in typesetting conventions between Panda (row-vector compatible) and OpenGL (column-vector compatible). It also notes that DirectX aligns with Panda in both typesetting and memory storage.\n\nInteroperability with OpenGL and DirectX\n\nPanda is code-compatible with both OpenGL and DirectX. All three use the same storage format: derivatives wrt xi first. You can pass a panda matrix directly to OpenGL's \"glLoadMatrixf\" or DirectX's \"SetTransform\".\n\nHowever, remember that typesetting format and data storage format are independent choices. Even though two engines are interoperable at the code level (because their data storage formats match), their manuals might disagree with each other (because their typesetting formats do not match).\n\nThe panda typesetting conventions and the OpenGL typesetting conventions are opposite from each other. The OpenGL manuals use a column-vector-compatible notation. The Panda manuals use a row-vector-compatible notation.\n\nDirectX uses the same conventions as Panda for both typesetting and memory storage: row vectors on the left, row major storage with the translation in the bottom row.",
