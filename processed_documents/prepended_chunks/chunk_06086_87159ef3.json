  "content": "The chunk is situated in a section discussing how Panda3D handles stereo display setups. It explains the default method of creating off-axis frustums for stereo rendering and provides alternatives for users who need different types of frustums, such as toe-in. This follows an explanation of stereo channel settings and lens parameters like interocular distance and convergence.\n\nContext: Discussing stereo frustum types and customization options in Panda3D's StereoDisplayRegion management.\n\nNote that the default stereo frustums that Panda creates are off-axis frustums, not toe-in frustums. That is, both the left and the right eyes are still pointing in the precise same direction as the center camera, but the frustum is distorted a bit to make objects converge approximately at the requested distance. This is generally regarded as producing a superior stereo effect over the more naive toe-in approach, in which the left and right eyes are simply tilted towards each other to provide the required convergence.\n\nIf you require a different stereo frustum--for instance, if you wish to use toe-in stereo, or some other kind of stereo frustum of your choosing--you may simply set each DisplayRegion to use its own camera (instead of both sharing the same camera), and assign the particular frustum you wish to each eye.\n\nNote",
