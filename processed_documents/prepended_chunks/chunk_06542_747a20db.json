  "content": "The chunk describes the methods of an `AnimationController` in Panda3D, detailing how to interact with and manipulate animations on actors. It includes functions like `isPlaying()`, `getFrame()`, and `setPlayRate()`, which are essential for controlling animation playback, such as checking status, retrieving current frames, adjusting speed, looping, starting/stopping animations, and posing at specific frames. These methods provide developers with the tools to fine-tune animations in 3D applications.\n\nmyAnimControl.isPlaying() #returns a boolean whether the animation is playing or not\nmyAnimControl.getFrame() #returns the current frame number\nmyAnimControl #returns the speed of the animation, in frames per second\nmyAnimControl.getFullFframe() #returns a floating-point frame number exceeding the framecount. Not recommended.\nmyAnimControl.getFullFrame() #returns an integer frame number exceeding the framecount. Not recommended.\nmyAnimControl.getNextFrame() #returns the number of the next frame on the queue.\nmyAnimControl.getNumFrames() #returns the total number of frames\nmyAnimControl.getPlayRate() #returns the playrate. explained further below\nmyAnimControl.loop() #starts playing the animation in a loop\nmyAnimControl.play() #starts playing the animation\nmyAnimControl.pose(frame) #poses at frame frame\nmyAnimControl.setPlayRate(rate) #sets the playrate. explained further below\nmyAnimControl.stop() #stops the animation\n\nPlay rate",
