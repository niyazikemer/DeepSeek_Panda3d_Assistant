  "content": "This code chunk is part of a task function that handles real-time camera manipulation based on mouse input. It adjusts the camera's heading and pitch (HPR) relative to a reference point (`camManipRef`) using delta values from mouse movements. The code includes an option to lock the roll angle if `self.lockRoll` is enabled, ensuring smooth camera orientation updates during interaction. This functionality is part of a larger system for 3D scene manipulation, including view switching and undo operations.\n\nwrt = direct.camera.getTransform(self.camManipRef)\n            self.camManipRef.setHpr(self.camManipRef,\n                                    (dirX * deltaX * 180.0),\n                                    (deltaY * 180.0),\n                                    0.0)\n\n            if self.lockRoll:\n                # flatten roll\n                self.camManipRef.setR(0)\n            direct.camera.setTransform(self.camManipRef, wrt)\n        return Task.cont",
