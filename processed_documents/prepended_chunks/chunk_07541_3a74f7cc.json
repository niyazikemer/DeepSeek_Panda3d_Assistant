  "content": "The section explains how the `set_linear_fallback` method is used in linear fog rendering to handle situations where the fog effect diminishes due to large viewing angles between the camera direction and fog vector. It describes the parameters of the fallback mechanism and discusses the limitations of linear fog compared to exponential fog, which is generally more versatile and widely applicable.\n\nThe .Fog method set_linear_fallback(float angle, float onset, float opaque) <.Fog.set_linear_fallback> defines how the fog should be rendered when the fog effect is diminished in this way. angle is the minimum viewing angle (angle between the camera direction and fog direction) at which the fallback effect will be employed. onset and opaque specify camera-relative onset and opaque distances that will be fallen back on, overriding the .Fog node\u2019s own onset and opaque distances.\n\nThe linear fallback workaround will only look good in certain situations, for example when the fog is deep inside a dark cave. So in general, exponential mode fog is more useful than the default linear mode fog.\n\nExponential Fog",
