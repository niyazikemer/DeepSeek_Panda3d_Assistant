  "content": "This chunk is part of a document explaining how to run sample programs in Panda3D, specifically focusing on the \"Asteroids\" program. It provides information about installing Panda3D, locating sample programs on different operating systems (Windows and Linux), and using tasks to update ship, asteroid, and bullet positions while checking for collisions. It also includes a performance note about processor-intensive tasks.\n\nSample Programs: Asteroids\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nThis sample program shows how to use Tasks. Tasks are functions that run during every frame of the program. Panda3D runs a number of tasks during any program, but additional tasks may be added. For this tutorial, tasks will be used to update the ship, asteroid and bullet positions, in addition to checking for collisions. To do this, all the data you need to know is how much time has passed and the velocity of each object.\n\nNote\n\nAdding lots of processor intensive tasks will have an adverse affect on the framerate/performance of your program.\n\nFor more information on tasks, please consult the tasks section of the manual.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
