  "content": "This chunk is situated within a comprehensive document detailing various configuration options for graphics and rendering in Panda3D. It specifically addresses OpenGL-related settings, including the use of bindless samplers, vertex array objects, and shader validation, which are crucial for optimizing rendering performance and ensuring correct shader behavior.\n\nthat all sampler uniforms have a layout(bindless_sampler) qualifier, and\nit also requires that the texture properties are not modified after the\ntexture handle has been initialized. gl-validate-shaders bool 1 Set this to true to enable glValidateShader the first time a shader\nis bound. This may cause helpful information about shaders to be\nprinted. gl-version int Set this to get an OpenGL context with a specific version. gl-vertex-array-objects bool 1 Setting this causes Panda to make use of vertex array objects to\nmore efficiently switch between sets of vertex arrays. This only has\neffect when vertex-arrays and vertex-buffers are both set. This should\nusually be true unless you suspect a bug in the implementation. glsl-include-recursion-limit int 10 This sets a limit on how many nested #pragma include directives that\nPanda will follow when glsl-preprocess is enabled. This is used to\nprevent infinite recursion when two shader files include each",
