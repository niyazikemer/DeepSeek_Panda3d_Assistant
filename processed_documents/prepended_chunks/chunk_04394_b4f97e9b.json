  "content": "The chunk should be situated within the context of the `loadFont` method's documentation in the Loader class. It explains parameters that affect the rendering quality and texture generation of font characters when loading fonts for graphical applications.\n\n```python\ndef loadFont(self, fileName, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Loads a font file (e.g., TTF or FON) and returns a TextNode.\n\n    scaleFactor controls the visual quality by determining how much larger characters are rendered before scaling down to fit within the texture. Increasing this value can reduce artifacts in small text but increases processing time during character generation.\n\n    textureMargin specifies the number of pixels left between adjacent characters in the texture, helping prevent bleed-through and edge artifacts, especially for small-scale text.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nscaleFactor also controls the visual quality of the rendered\n        text characters.  It is the amount by which the characters are\n        rendered bigger out of Freetype, and then downscaled to fit\n        within the texture.  Increasing this number may reduce some\n        artifacts of very small font characters, at a small cost of\n        processing time to generate the characters initially.\n\n        textureMargin specifies the number of pixels of the texture to\n        leave between adjacent characters.  It may be a floating-point\n        number.  This helps reduce bleed-through from nearby\n        characters within the texture space.  Increasing this number\n        reduces artifacts at the edges of the character cells\n        (especially for very small text scales), at the expense of\n        texture memory.",
