  "content": "This document explains how to create soft bodies using triangular meshes in Bullet, particularly focusing on setting up a gas-filled ellipsoid. It details the process of creating a soft body node, configuring its properties, and visualizing it within a scene, emphasizing the use of higher-resolution meshes for more realistic simulations.\n\nBullet Softbody Triangles\n\nSoft bodies made from triangular meshes are similar to soft body patches. just that they are not restricted to rectangular meshes; any two-dimensional triangle mesh will do. An interesting use case for such a soft body is a triangular mesh which is closed. Bullet supports simulation of a pressure for the volume captured inside such a soft body.\n\nSetup\n\nThe following code snippet shows how to setup an gas-filled soft body. Instead of defining the triangle mesh ourselves we use the convenience method makeEllipsoid, which returns a ready-to-use soft body with the shape of an ellipsoid. The last parameter to this convenience method is the \"resolution\" of the ellipsoid. The soft body will have more faces if raising this value. Increasing the value will make the soft body more realistic, but it also requires more performance to simulate the soft body.\n\npython",
