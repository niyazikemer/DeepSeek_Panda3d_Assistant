  "content": "The provided chunk situates within a broader discussion of configuration options for graphics rendering, window behavior, and simulation parameters in a 3D application. The context includes variables related to shader functionality, image file settings (BMP), bounding volume types, debugging tools (buffer viewer layout/position/size), and physics simulation stability (additional damping).\n\nshader functionality which tends to be unreliable or broken. At some\npoint, when functionality that is currently flaky becomes reliable, we\nmay expand the definition of what constitutes 'basic' shaders. bmp-bpp int 0 This controls how many bits per pixel are written out for BMP files.\nIf this is zero, the default, the number of bits per pixel is based on\nthe image. bounds-type enum sphere Specify the type of bounding volume that is created automatically by\nPanda to enclose geometry. Use 'sphere' or 'box', or use 'best' to let\nPanda decide which is most appropriate. You can also use 'fastest' if\nyou don't want Panda to waste much time computing the most optimal\nbounding volume. buffer-viewer-layout string hline buffer-viewer-position string lrcorner buffer-viewer-size double 0 0 bullet-additional-damping bool 0 Enables additional damping on eachrigid body, in order to reduce\njitter. Default value is FALSE. Additional damping is an experimental",
