  "content": "The section provides examples demonstrating various ways to construct path strings for searching nodes in the scene graph, including examples for node name matching, type-based matching, and tag-based searches, followed by an explanation of optional control flags that can be appended to modify the search behavior.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"room//graph\" will look for a node named \"graph\", which is a child of an unnamed node, which is a child of a node named \"room\", which is a child of the starting path.\n\n\"**/red*\" will look for any node anywhere in the tree (below the starting path) with a name that begins with \"red\".\n\n\"**/+PartBundleNode/**/head\" will look for a node named \"head\", somewhere below a PartBundleNode anywhere in the tree.\n\nThe argument may also be followed by one or more optional control flags. To use a control flag, add a semicolon after the argument, followed by at least one of the special flags with no extra spaces or punctuation.",
