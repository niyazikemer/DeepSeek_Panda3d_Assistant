  "content": "The provided code chunk appears to be part of a fragment shader implementation related to volumetric lighting or glow effects in a graphics rendering context. It manipulates color values and decay factors, which are common operations when implementing effects like bloom or view glow. This type of code would typically be found within the shader programs used by functions such as `setVolumetricLighting` or `setViewGlow`, where custom post-processing effects are applied to achieve specific visual enhancements in the rendered scene.\n\ntext += \"    sample *= sample.a * decay;//*weight\\n\"\n                text += \"    vlcolor += sample.rgb;\\n\"\n                text += \"    decay *= k_vlparams.y;\\n\"\n                text += \"  }\\n\"\n                text += \"  o_color += float4(vlcolor * k_vlparams.z, 1);\\n\"",
