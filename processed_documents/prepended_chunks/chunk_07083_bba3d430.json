  "content": "The provided chunk introduces the necessity of performance optimization in game development, highlighting its importance as complexity increases and ensuring smooth gameplay across different hardware.\n\nPerformance Optimization\n\nAt some point in the development process, as developers add more and more code and content to their games, they will notice that the game runs more and more slowly, with movements starting to appear jittery instead of smooth. At this stage, it becomes necessary to consider performance optimization.\n\nEven if the game is running fast on the developer's machine, it is usually still worth it to perform performance analysis before releasing the product publicly. Some players may be using older hardware that is not as powerful as the developers' machines, and optimizing the game will maximize the amount of players that can enjoy the game.",
