  "content": "The provided chunk discusses the **GeomPoints** primitive type, which should be situated within the section describing different types of GeomPrimitive objects used for rendering in Panda3D. Specifically, it belongs directly after explaining other primitive types like **GeomLinestrips**, as it describes another fundamental element used for rendering points in 3D space.\n\n```plaintext\n... \n\n**GeomPoints**\n\nThis is the simplest kind of GeomPrimitive; it stores a number of individual points.

Each point has exactly one vertex.\n\nBy default, each point is rendered as one pixel. You can use nodePath.set_render_mode_thickness() <.NodePath.set_render_mode_thickness> to change this; if you specify a thickness greater than 1, this will make the points render as squares (which always face the camera), where the vertex coordinate is the center point of the square, and the square has the specified number of pixels along each side. Each point will always be the same width in pixels, no matter how far it is from the camera. Unlike line segments, thick points are supported by DirectX.",
