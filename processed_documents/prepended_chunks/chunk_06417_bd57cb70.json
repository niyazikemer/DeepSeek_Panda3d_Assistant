  "content": "This chunk introduces the concept of using cube maps for environment mapping in Panda3D, explaining how they function similarly to sphere maps but offer improvements such as camera-relative reflections, setting the stage for discussing their implementation and benefits over traditional sphere mapping techniques.\n\nEnvironment Mapping with Cube Maps\n\nAlthough there are other applications for cube maps, one very common use of cube maps is as an environment map, similar to sphere mapping <simple-environment-mapping>. In fact, it works very much the same as sphere mapping.\n\nJust as with a sphere map, you can have Panda3D generate a cube map for you:\n\nscene = loader.loadModel('bvw-f2004--streetscene/street-scene.egg')\nscene.reparentTo(render)\nscene.setZ(-2)\nbase.saveCubeMap('streetscene_cube_#.jpg', size = 256)\n\nWith the cube map saved out as above, you could apply it as an environment map to the teapot like this:\n\ntex = loader.loadCubeMap('streetscene_cube_#.jpg')\nteapot.setTexGen(TextureStage.getDefault(), TexGenAttrib.MEyeCubeMap)\nteapot.setTexture(tex)\n\nAnd the result looks very similar to the sphere map:",
