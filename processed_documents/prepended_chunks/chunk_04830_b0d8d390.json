The code demonstrates how to render an object\u2019s view from above, simulating sunlight, and project the resulting image onto the world as shadows through multitexturing. The functions included allow for creating shadows for specific objects like avatars or arbitrary models.\n\n\"\"\"Create a cheesy shadow effect by rendering the view of an\nobject (e.g. the local avatar) from a special camera as seen from\nabove (as if from the sun), using a solid gray foreground and a\nsolid white background, and then multitexturing that view onto the\nworld.\n\nThis is meant primarily as a demonstration of multipass and\nmultitexture rendering techniques.  It's not a particularly great\nway to do shadows.\n\"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ['ShadowCaster', 'avatarShadow', 'piratesAvatarShadow', 'arbitraryShadow']\n\nfrom panda3d.core import Camera, NodePath, OrthographicLens, Texture, TextureStage, VBase4\nfrom direct.task import Task\nfrom direct.task.TaskManagerGlobal import taskMgr\n\nsc = None",
