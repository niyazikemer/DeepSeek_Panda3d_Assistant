  "content": "These functions `newCreateVector2Entry` and `newCreateVector3Entry` are part of an object-oriented Python application shell framework. They define methods for creating and configuring custom Vector2 and Vector3 entry widgets within a GUI application. The widgets are used to input 2D or 3D vector data, respectively, and integrate with the application's component management system, which handles widget creation, help binding, and status updates.\n\ndef newCreateVector2Entry(self, parent, category, text,\n                              help = '', command = None,\n                              side = tk.LEFT, fill = tk.X, expand = 0, **kw):\n        # Create the widget\n        widget = self.createWidget(parent, category, text,\n                                   VectorWidgets.Vector2Entry,\n                                   help, command, side, fill, expand, kw)\n\n    def newCreateVector3Entry(self, parent, category, text,\n                              help = '', command = None,\n                              side = tk.LEFT, fill = tk.X, expand = 0, **kw):\n        # Create the widget\n        widget = self.createWidget(parent, category, text,\n                                   VectorWidgets.Vector3Entry,\n                                   help, command, side, fill, expand, kw)\n        return widget",
