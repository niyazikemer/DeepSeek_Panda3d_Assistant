  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a class that manages a grid-based system for tracking objects (such as avatars) in an AI environment. The chunk includes functionality to stop a task when there are no longer any objects being managed, introduces a task for updating the zones of moving objects, and provides methods to start this task. This context explains how the system efficiently tracks and updates object locations within a grid framework.\n\n# Stop task if there are no more av's being managed\n        if len(self.gridObjects) == 0:\n            self.stopUpdateGridTask()\n\n    #####################################################################\n    # updateGridTask\n    # This task is similar to the processVisibility task for the local client.\n    # A couple differences:\n    #  - we are not doing setInterest on the AI (that is a local client\n    #    specific call).\n    #  - we assume that the moving objects on the grid are parented to a\n    #    gridParent, and are broadcasting their position relative to that\n    #    gridParent.  This makes the task's math easy.  Just check to see\n    #    when our position goes out of the current grid cell.  When it does,\n    #    call handleAvatarZoneChange\n\n    def startUpdateGridTask(self):\n        self.stopUpdateGridTask()\n        self.updateTaskStarted = 1\n        taskMgr.add(self.updateGridTask, self.taskName(\"updateGridTask\"))",
