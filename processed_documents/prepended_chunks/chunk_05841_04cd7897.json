  "content": "The provided chunk introduces the concept of `.DisplayRegion` in Panda3D, explaining its necessity for rendering scenes within a window. It describes how to create a `.DisplayRegion`, either covering the entire window or specifying dimensions using normalized coordinates (0-1 range), and provides code examples in Python and C++ for implementation. This section is foundational for understanding how to set up basic or multiple display regions, each associated with a specific camera view.\n\nDisplay Regions\n\nA new window can't render anything until it has at least one .DisplayRegion. A DisplayRegion is necessary to associate a camera with the window.\n\nA .DisplayRegion is a rectangular area of the window that contains the rendered scene, as viewed by one particular camera. Usually, you create just one DisplayRegion that covers the entire window, although you can create as many different smaller regions as you like, each one displaying the output from a different camera.\n\nYou can create a DisplayRegion with the ~.GraphicsOutput.make_display_region() call on a window:\n\npython\n\nregion = win.makeDisplayRegion()\nregion = win.makeDisplayRegion(left, right, bottom, top)\n\ncpp\n\nPT(DisplayRegion) region = win.make_display_region();\nPT(DisplayRegion) region = win.make_display_region(left, right, bottom, top);",
