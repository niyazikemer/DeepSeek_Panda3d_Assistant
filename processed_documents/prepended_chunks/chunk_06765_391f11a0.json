  "content": "The document describes various Panda3D configuration settings, including window properties, collision detection optimizations, and file handling. The chunk discusses the `flatten-geoms` setting, which controls how NodePath flattening combines Geoms for efficiency in collision tests, and the `flt-error-abort` setting, which triggers an assertion on errors reading or writing FLTD files. This context is relevant to understanding performance optimization in 3D rendering and debugging file operations in Panda3D.\n\nsince collision tests rely heavily on bounding volume tests to be\nefficient, and combining CollisionNodes is likely to merge bounding\nvolumes inappropriately. flatten-geoms bool 1 When this is true (the default), NodePath::flatten_strong() and\nflatten_medium() will attempt to combine multiple Geoms into as few\nGeoms as possible, by combing GeomVertexDatas and then unifying. Setting\nthis false disables this behavior, so that NodePath flatten operations\nwill only reduce nodes. This affects only the NodePath interfaces; you\nmay still make the lower-level SceneGraphReducer calls directly. flt-error-abort bool 0 Set this true to trigger an assertion failure (and core dump)\nimmediately when an error is detected on reading or writing a flt file.\nThis is primarily useful for debugging the flt reader itself, to\ngenerate a stack trace to determine precisely at what point a flt file",
