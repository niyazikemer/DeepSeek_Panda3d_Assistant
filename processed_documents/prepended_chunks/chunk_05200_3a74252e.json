The code provides foundational setup for handling interest addition and removal operations, essential for tracking and updating zones of interest in real-time.\n\n\"\"\"\nThe DoInterestManager keeps track of which parent/zones that we currently\nhave interest in.  When you want to \"look\" into a zone you add an interest\nto that zone.  When you want to get rid of, or ignore, the objects in that\nzone, remove interest in that zone.\n\np.s.
