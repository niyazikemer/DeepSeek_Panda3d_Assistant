  "content": "The chunk explains the implementation and functionality of exponential fog mode in computer graphics. It describes how exponential fog differs from linear fog by being rendered camera-relative without requiring specific node placement in the scene graph, relying instead on a density factor that increases exponentially with distance from the camera. The chunk also provides an example code snippet demonstrating how to set up scene-wide exponential fog using Python.\n\nExponential Fog\n\nIn exponential fog mode the position and orientation of your fog node in the scene graph and the onset and opaque points are ignored (in fact you don\u2019t even have to put your fog node in the scene graph). Instead, fog is rendered camera relative according to a density factor: the fog begins at the camera and continues to infinity, with an exponentially increasing density determined by the density factor. The fog moves with the camera as the camera\u2019s position and orientation changes:\n\n\"the onset point and opaque point are not used, and the fog effect is based on the value specified to ~.Fog.set_exp_density(), and it doesn\u2019t matter to which node the fog object is parented, or if it is parented anywhere at all.\"\n\nThe .Fog.set_exp_density() method determines the density value used for exponential fog calculations. The below example uses it to set up some scene-wide exponential fog:\n\npython",
