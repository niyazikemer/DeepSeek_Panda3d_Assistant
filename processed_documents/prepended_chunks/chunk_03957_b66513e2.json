  "content": "The `CommonFilters` class in the provided code implements a collection of common image post-processing filters. This specific chunk introduces the class structure, its initialization method, cleanup process, and initial configuration setup. The `__init__` method initializes the filter manager with a window and camera, sets up configurations for filters, and prepares necessary textures and quads for rendering effects like bloom or SSAO. The `cleanup` method releases resources, removing any allocated textures and stopping related tasks. This segment is foundational to setting up and managing image post-processing pipelines in applications utilizing Panda3D graphics engine.\n\nclass CommonFilters:\n    \"\"\" Class CommonFilters implements certain common image postprocessing\n    filters.
