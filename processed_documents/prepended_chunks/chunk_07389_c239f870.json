  "content": "The chunk explains the construction methods for `CollisionBox` in a 3D environment, detailing two ways to define its dimensions, followed by an overview of the **Collision System Chart** that outlines compatibility between different collision solids.\n\nThere are two constructors for the Box. One of them specifies the center for the box as well as the distance of each of the sides from the center.\n\nbox = CollisionBox(center, dx, dy, dz)\n\nThe second form of constructor takes the two diagonally opposite end points of the AABB.\n\nbox = CollisionBox(Point3(minx, miny, minz), Point3(maxx, maxy, maxz))\n\nCollision System Chart\n\nHere is a table of the Collision Solids that can be used as \"from\" and \"into\" objects in a Collision.\n\nAt noted above, with no volume CollisionRay, CollisionLine, CollisionParabola, CollisionSegment are only \"from\", never \"into\" and hence not listed as columns in the table below.\n\nAt present, CollisionFloorMesh, CollisionInvSphere, CollisionPlane, and CollisionPolygon are only \"into\" and never \"from\" and hence are not listed as rows in the table below.\n\nIn the table below, the solid is listed without its \"Collision\" preface, e.g., \"Sphere\" instead of \"CollisionSphere\", to save on space.",
