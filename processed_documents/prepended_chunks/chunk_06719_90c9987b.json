It includes variables such as platform-specific libraries, average frame rate intervals, back buffer counts, background colors, BAM file endianness, and floating-point handling. These elements are part of a larger collection of configuration options aimed at customizing application behavior across different platforms and performance requirements.\n\nparticular platform. This variable may be repeated several times. These\nlibraries will be tried one at a time if the library specified by\nload_display cannot be loaded. average-frame-rate-interval double 1.0 See ClockObject::set_average_frame_rate_interval(). back-buffers int 1 The default number of back buffers requested. background-color color 0.41 0.41 0.41 0.0 Specifies the rgb(a) value of the default background color for a new\nwindow or offscreen buffer. bam-endian enum littleendian The default endianness to use for writing major numeric data tables\nto bam files. This does not affect all numbers written to bam files,\nonly those for which the individual object was designed to support this\nflag. The default is \"native\"; you may set it to \"littleendian\" or\n\"bigendian\" to target a particular platform. bam-stdfloat-double bool 0 The default width of floating-point numbers to write to a bam file.\nSet this true to force doubles (64-bit floats), or false to force",
