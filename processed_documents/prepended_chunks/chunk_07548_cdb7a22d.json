  "content": "The provided chunk introduces fundamental concepts about 3D models, shaders, and how hardware interacts with them. It explains vertex structures in egg files, texture application in Panda3D, and sets the stage for shader basics in subsequent tutorials.\n\n**Context:** This section is foundational, detailing model structure and GPU processing to prepare for exploring shaders.\n\n3D Models, Shaders and Hardware\n\nNow that we have the basic script, lets take a look at how 3d models, shaders and the 3d hardware interact with each other. Please open the file cube.egg with a text editor. Egg files are human readable. We will need this information later on to understand how the vertex shader and the fragment shader works. You can also see how the model looks like in panda by using the pview model viewer.\n\n// A vertex entry in an egg file\n<Group> {\n  <VertexPool> Cube {\n    <Vertex> 0 {\n      1.0 1.0 -1.0\n      <UV> { 1.0 1.0 }\n      RGBA> { 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 }\n    }\n    ...",
