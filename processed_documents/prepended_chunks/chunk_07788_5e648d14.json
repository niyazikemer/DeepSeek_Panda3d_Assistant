  "content": "This chunk is part of the section detailing the functionality of the `DistributedSmoothNode` class, which manages smooth movement for objects like players in a distributed environment. The methods `.stopSmooth()` and `.startPosHprBroadcast()` are crucial for controlling the task that updates node positioning and broadcasting positional data to connected clients, ensuring seamless movement synchronization across the network.\n\nTo stop the task that will update the smooth positioning every frame, simply call the following method.\n\n.DistributedSmoothNode.stopSmooth()\n\n.DistributedSmoothNode.startPosHprBroadcast(period=.2, stagger=0, type=None)\n\nFinally, having all that set and done, one last call is needed to propagate the location and rotation of the node. While the other methods handle the local smoothing on the other connected clients, the startPosHprBroadcast method will handle the distribution of the transformations from the source node to the connected target clients.",
