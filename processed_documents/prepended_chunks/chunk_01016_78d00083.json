  "content": "The function `initializeInspectorMap()` initializes a global variable `_InspectorMap` by defining a list of \"not finished\" object types that the inspector does not handle. This setup is crucial for ensuring the inspector skips unsupported types, enhancing its reliability. The chunk is situated in the initialization phase, likely at the top of the file or within an `__init__` method to set up global state before Inspector operations begin.\n\n**Context:** Initializes global state for the Inspector class, defining object types it should skip due to lack of support.\n\ndef initializeInspectorMap():\n    global _InspectorMap\n    notFinishedTypes = ['BufferType',  'EllipsisType',  'FrameType', 'TracebackType', 'XRangeType']",
