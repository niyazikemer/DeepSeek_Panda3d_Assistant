  "content": "This chunk explains how to set an initial render state for a camera node in Panda3D during multi-pass rendering, ensuring that all objects in the scene are drawn according to the specified state while allowing further attribute overrides.\n\nEach .Camera node has a function called set_initial_state(state) <.Camera.set_initial_state>. It makes every object in the scene get drawn as if the top node in its scene graph has state as its .RenderState. This still means that attributes <render-attributes> can be changed/overridden after the .Camera has been put on a scene.\n\npython\n\n# This makes everything drawn by the default camera use myNodePath's\n# RenderState.\nbase.cam.node().setInitialState(myNodePath.getState())\n\ncpp\n\n// This makes everything drawn by the default camera use myNodePath's\n// RenderState.\nwindow->get_camera(0)->set_initial_state(myNodePath.get_state());",
