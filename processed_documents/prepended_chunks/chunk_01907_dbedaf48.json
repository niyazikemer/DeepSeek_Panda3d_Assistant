  "content": "This chunk defines the `create_nsis` function, which is responsible for generating an NSIS installer script (.nsi file) for Windows platforms. It checks if the required `makensis` tool is available, lists GUI and console applications to include in the installer, and writes the necessary NSIS instructions to a file. The function is part of a larger module focused on creating installers for Windows distributions, particularly targeting 32-bit or 64-bit platforms based on the detected architecture.\n\ndef create_nsis(command, basename, build_dir):\n    platform = command.get_current_platform()\n    if not platform.startswith('win'):\n        command.announce(\n            '\\tNSIS installer not supported for platform: {}'.format(platform),\n            distutils.log.ERROR\n        )\n        return\n    try:\n        subprocess.call(['makensis', '--version'])\n    except OSError:\n        command.announce(\n            '\\tCould not find makensis tool that is required to build NSIS installers',\n            distutils.log.ERROR\n        )\n        return\n\n    is_64bit = platform == 'win_amd64'\n    # Get a list of build applications\n    build_cmd = command.get_finalized_command('build_apps')\n    apps = build_cmd.gui_apps.copy()\n    apps.update(build_cmd.console_apps)\n    apps = [\n        '{}.exe'.format(i)\n        for i in apps\n    ]\n\n    shortname = command.distribution.get_name()",
