The chunk provides instructions for using the `egg-optchar` tool to mark particular geometry as separate, enabling independent manipulation, such as changing textures or positions. This is essential when working with animated models to ensure specific parts like a character's head remain accessible and editable after optimization.\n```\n\nYour first step is to note the name of the object in your modeling program. For example, suppose you want to control the texture of a model's head, and suppose (hypothetically) the head is labeled \"Sphere01\" in your modeling program. Use egg-optchar to tell panda that \"Sphere01\" deserves to be kept separate and labeled:\n\negg-optchar -d outputDir -flag Sphere01=theHead modelFile.egg anim1.egg anim2.egg\n\nNote that you must always supply the model file(s) and all of its animation files to egg-optchar at the same time. This is so it can examine all of the joints and determine which joints are actually animated; and it can remove joints by operating on all the files at once. The output of egg-optchar is written into the directory named by the \"-d\" parameter.",
