  "content": "The context is part of a Cg shader tutorial discussing vertex shaders, their functionality, and limitations. The section explains that while vertex shaders can manipulate vertex properties like position, they cannot create or delete vertices, highlighting the need for geometry shaders to overcome such constraints.\n\nNow, lets look at the shader that we have in this tutorial. As previously mentioned, the vshader function handles vertices. The only thing a vertex shader can do is calculate properties for vertices. One such property is the position. A vertex shader can move vertices around. In this tutorial we only move around the vertices but in the next tutorial we will calculate more properties for the vertex. A vertex shader cannot create new vertices nor can it delete vertices. This is a limitation that geometry shaders try to solve.",
