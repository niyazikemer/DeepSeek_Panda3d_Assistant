  "content": "The document provides an overview of Panda3D's `GeomVertexReader`, `GeomVertexWriter`, and `GeomVertexRewriter` classes, explaining how they are used for reading from, writing to, or both interacting with vertex data in a `GeomVertexData` object. The chunk situates within the section discussing `GeomVertexRewriter`, illustrating its usage through an example that modifies vertex coordinates while iterating through the data.\n\nNormally, you would use a GeomVertexRewriter to walk through the list of vertices from the beginning to end, reading and writing as it goes. For instance, to set all of the Z components of a piece of geometry to 0.0, while preserving the X and Y components, you might write a loop such as:\n\nvertex = GeomVertexRewriter(vdata, 'vertex')\nwhile not vertex.isAtEnd():\n    v = vertex.getData3()\n    vertex.setData3(v[0], v[1], 0.0)\n\nNote that this example code calls getData3() and setData3() exactly once through each iteration, which increments the current read row and current write row, respectively; so the current read row and current write row are kept in sync with each other.",
