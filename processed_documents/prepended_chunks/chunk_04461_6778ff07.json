  "content": "The `attachSoundToObject` method is a crucial part of the `Audio3DManager` class, which manages 3D audio attributes such as position, velocity, and distance effects. This method specifically allows developers to associate an audio source with a scene object, ensuring that the sound's spatial properties (like position and Doppler effect) update dynamically as the object moves or changes state. If the object is deleted, any attached sounds are automatically removed, contributing to efficient resource management and preventing issues related to dangling references in 3D audio implementations.\n\ndef attachSoundToObject(self, sound, object):\n        \"\"\"\n        Sound will come from the location of the object it is attached to.\n        If the object is deleted, the sound will automatically be removed.\n        \"\"\"\n        # sound is an AudioSound\n        # object is any Panda object with coordinates\n        for known_object in list(self.sound_dict.keys()):\n            if self.sound_dict[known_object].count(sound):\n                # This sound is already attached to something\n                #return 0\n                # detach sound\n                self.sound_dict[known_object].remove(sound)\n                if len(self.sound_dict[known_object]) == 0:\n                    # if there are no other sounds, don't track\n                    # the object any more\n                    del self.sound_dict[known_object]\n\n        if object not in self.sound_dict:\n            self.sound_dict[WeakNodePath(object)] = []\n\n        self.sound_dict[object].append(sound)\n        return 1",
