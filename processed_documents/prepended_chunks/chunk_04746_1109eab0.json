  "content": "The chunk introduces a new class `GarbageLeakDetector` which inherits from `LeakDetector`. The purpose of this detector is to check for accumulated Python garbage by performing a garbage collection, counting the number of objects in `gc.garbage`, and then clearing that list. This detector helps identify potential memory leaks related to unreferenced but uncollectable objects in the Python interpreter.\n\n**Succinct context:**  \nThe new class `GarbageLeakDetector` is added as another type of leak detection mechanism, focusing on identifying accumulated garbage objects in the Python interpreter after performing a garbage collection. It provides insight into potential memory leaks by counting and clearing objects that are kept alive by the garbage collector but have no references left.\n\n```python\nclass GarbageLeakDetector(LeakDetector):\n    # Check for accumulated Python garbage as another form of leak detection\n    def __len__(self):\n        # Perform garbage collection, count, clear, then restore settings\n        oldFlags = gc.get_debug()\n        gc.set_debug(0)\n        gc.collect()\n        numGarbage = len(gc.garbage)\n        del gc.garbage[:]\n        gc.set_debug(oldFlags)\n        return numGarbage\n```\n\nThis addition complements existing detectors by monitoring another critical area that could indicate memory leaks, ensuring comprehensive leak detection coverage.\n\nclass GarbageLeakDetector(LeakDetector):\n    # are we accumulating Python garbage?\n    def __len__(self):\n        # do a garbage collection\n        oldFlags = gc.get_debug()\n        gc.set_debug(0)\n        gc.collect()\n        numGarbage = len(gc.garbage)\n        del gc.garbage[:]\n        gc.set_debug(oldFlags)\n        return numGarbage",
