  "content": "The `BufferedDistancePhasedNode` class is initialized with several parameters that define how phases are managed and transitions occur. The `phaseParamMap` parameter specifies distances for different phase aliases and their corresponding functions, such as loading or unloading specific content when transitioning between phases. This section explains how these parameters configure the behavior of phase transitions and collision detection within the class structure.\n\nYou specify the distances and function names by the phaseParamMap\n    parameter to `__init__()`.  For example::\n\n        phaseParamMap = {'Alias': distance, ...}\n        ...\n        def loadPhaseAlias(self):\n            pass\n        def unloadPhaseAlias(self):\n            pass\n\n    If the 'fromCollideNode' is supplied, we will set up our own\n    traverser and only traverse below this node.  It will send out\n    events of the form '<enterPrefix>%in' and '<exitPrefix>%in' in\n    order to match the main collision traverser's patterns.  Note\n    that this will only be used after a reset or phase change in\n    order to fully transition to the correct phase in a single pass.\n    Most of the time, it will be reacting to events from the main\n    collision traverser.\n\n    IMPORTANT:",
