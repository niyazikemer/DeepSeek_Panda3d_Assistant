  "content": "The chunk provides instructions on how to use the Command Prompt or Terminal to navigate directories and execute a Python script named main.py. It is situated under the \"Running your Program\" section, which includes guidance for running Panda3D programs using different methods across various operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. This particular part focuses on command-line execution in a terminal environment.\n\nRunning your Program\n\npython\n\nUsing Command Prompt to Run your Program\n\nYou can run your script by using your computer's \"Terminal\" or \"Command Prompt\". When you open it, it should look something like this:\n\nAt the moment it\u2019s pointing to its default directory, which is typically the user directory in C:\\Users\\username, /home/user or /Users/user, depending on your operating system. We need to change the directory to the one where we saved our script. To do this, we use the cd command. This stands for \u2018change directory\u2019. For example, if the script is saved in a MyProject folder inside the home directory, we should type this:\n\ncd MyProject\n\nPlease note that this folder name is case-sensitive and must match exactly. Then, press the \u2018Enter\u2019 key on your keyboard. You should now have the following on the Command Prompt:\n\nThis means that it\u2019s now pointing to the right directory. Assuming the script has been named main.py, type the following text after the > symbol:\n\npython main.py",
