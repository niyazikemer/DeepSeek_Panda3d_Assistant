  "content": "The chunk appears after providing an example of the Scene Graph Analyzer output in the document, which details the complexity of a scene including nodes, geoms, vertices, normals, triangles, and textures. The purpose is to guide users to additional optimization strategies if their scene has too many static nodes or meshes, offering further solutions for performance improvement.\n\nTo optimize a scene with too many static nodes, see too-many-meshes for possible solutions.",
