  "content": "The provided code chunk appears to be part of a larger Python script that handles autodocumentation for a Sphinx project, specifically managing how different types of members (classes, methods, functions) are documented. The code snippet is likely located in a section where the script determines how to reference and process constructors, classes, methods, or functions during the documentation generation process. It appears to be part of a function that categorizes and references these elements appropriately for inclusion in the generated documentation.\n\n# This matches a constructor, but we want the class.\n                        return ('class', prefix + type_name)\n                    else:\n                        return ('meth', prefix + type_name + '.' + func_name)\n                else:\n                    prefix = interrogate_function_module_name(ifunc)\n                    if prefix:\n                        prefix += '.'\n                    return ('func', prefix + func_name)",
