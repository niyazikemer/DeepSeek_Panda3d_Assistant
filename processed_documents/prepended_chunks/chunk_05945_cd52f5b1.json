  "content": "This chunk appears within a document explaining the fundamentals of texturing in Panda3D, starting with basic concepts and transitioning to more complex topics. It confirms that Panda supports various image formats like JPG, PNG, and TIF, then lists detailed sections covering advanced techniques such as texture wrapping, filtering, multi-texturing, environment mapping, animations, transparency, management, compression, and creation.\n\nPanda can load JPG, PNG, TIF, and a number of other file formats.\n\nMore advanced texturing methods are described in the following sections.\n\nsimple-texturing choosing-a-texture-size texture-wrap-modes texture-filter-types simple-texture-replacement multitexture-introduction texture-modes texture-order texture-combine-modes texture-transforms multiple-texture-coordinate-sets automatic-texture-coordinates projected-textures simple-environment-mapping 3d-textures cube-maps environment-mapping-with-cube-maps automatic-texture-animation playing-mpg-and-avi-files multiview-textures transparency-and-blending texture-management texture-compression creating-textures",
