  "content": "The chunk describes setting up include and library directories for Panda3D within a C++ project, following instructions to configure platform toolsets and remove debugging symbols.\n\nNow, open up the project configuration pages. Change the \"Platform Toolset\" in the \"General\" tab to \"v140_xp\" (if you wish your project to be able to work on Windows XP) or \"v140\".\n\nFurthermore, we need to go to C/C++ -> \"Preprocessor Definitions\" and remove the NDEBUG symbol from the preprocessor definitions. This was automatically added when we switched to \"Release\" mode, but having this setting checked removes important debugging checks that we still want to keep until we are ready to publish the application.\n\nNow we are ready to add the paths to the Panda3D directories. Add the following paths to the appropriate locations (replace the path to Panda3D with the directory you installed Panda3D into, of course):\n\nInclude Directories\n\nC:\\Panda3D-|release|-x64\\include\n\nLibrary Directories\n\nC:\\Panda3D-|release|-x64\\lib",
