  "content": "The chunk discusses how a new hidden window is not automatically connected to the main scene graph and explains the process of creating a separate scene graph for rendering purposes in Panda3D's low-level buffer management. This context is relevant when exploring the creation of offscreen buffers, custom rendering setups, or managing multiple scene graphs within a single application.\n\nThe new hidden window is not automatically connected to the scene graph. In this example, we create a separate scene graph rooted at myscene, create a camera to view that scene graph, and connect the camera to mybuffer.",
