  "content": "This chunk is situated within a section discussing Panda3D's built-in support for handling mouse input across Python and C++. It provides essential information on how to disable the default camera control functionality in Python using `base.disableMouse()`, which only stops the camera-driving task while still allowing access to mouse position and click events. Additionally, it explains that in C++, enabling a task to drive the camera requires `window->setup_trackball();`, though mouse position and clicks can be accessed regardless of this setup. The chunk also includes code examples for retrieving mouse coordinates in both Python and C++. This section is part of a broader discussion on different modes of handling mouse input, including absolute vs relative mouse movement, controlling the camera with the mouse, and accessing mouse data from multiple mice or devices, as well as considerations for using raw mouse input under Linux.\n\nMouse Support\n\nPanda3D has mouse support built in.\n\npython\n\nIn Python, the default action of the mouse is to control the camera. If you want to disable this functionality you can use the command:\n\nbase.disableMouse()\n\nThis function's name is slightly misleading. It only disables the task that drives the camera around, it doesn't disable the mouse itself. You can still get the position of the mouse, as well as the mouse clicks.\n\ncpp\n\nIn C++, you need to do the following if you want the mouse to control the camera:\n\nwindow->setup_trackball();\n\nYou don't need to do this to enable the mouse itself, only to enable a task that drives the camera around. You can still get the position of the mouse, as well as the mouse clicks, even if you don't enable this \"trackball mode\".\n\nTo get the position:\n\npython\n\nif base.mouseWatcherNode.hasMouse():\n  x = base.mouseWatcherNode.getMouseX()\n  y = base.mouseWatcherNode.getMouseY()\n\ncpp",
