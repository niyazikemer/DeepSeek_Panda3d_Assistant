  "content": "The Bloom Filter section explains how post-processing effects like bloom are implemented in Panda3D by replacing the scene with a fullscreen quad textured with the scene and a shader implementing the selected filter. It also discusses handling video card limitations and enabling bloom filtering.\n\nIt will remove the scene from the specified window, and replace it with a fullscreen quad.\n\nThe quad will be textured with the scene, plus a shader that implements whatever filter you have selected.\n\nIf all goes well, the net effect is that your scene will continue to appear in your window, but it will be filtered as you specify.\n\nWhat if the Video Card can't handle it?\n\nIf the video card is not capable of implementing your filters, then all filters will be removed and the filter-enabling function will return False. Otherwise, filter-enabling functions will return True.\n\nThe Bloom Filter\n\nThe bloom filter causes bright objects to have a glowing halo around them. To enable a bloom filter, use setBloom. To disable, use delBloom:\n\nfilters.setBloom( ... options ...)\nfilters.delBloom()",
