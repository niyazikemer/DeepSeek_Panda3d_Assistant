This includes essential imports for handling 3D operations (BitMask32, Mat4, NodePath), object interaction via DirectSelection (SelectionRay), rope manipulation (Rope), and task management in the application (Task). These imports are foundational for enabling the creation and modification of curves within a 3D environment.\n\n\"\"\"\nThis is the module for curve edit\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom panda3d.core import BitMask32, Mat4, NodePath\nfrom direct.showbase.DirectObject import DirectObject\nfrom direct.directtools.DirectSelection import SelectionRay\nfrom direct.showutil.Rope import Rope\nfrom direct.task import Task",
