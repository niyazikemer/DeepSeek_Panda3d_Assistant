  "content": "The provided code chunk is situated within a section of the document discussing how textures are managed and displayed in a texture window application. Specifically, it pertains to the logic for updating and displaying textures onscreen based on whether the application is currently in \"isolate\" mode (where a single texture is displayed) or in \"main\" mode (where multiple textures are packed together). The code handles tasks such as refreshing isolated textures, repacking textures when transitioning back from isolate mode, and managing the display of all resident textures efficiently. This section ensures that the application correctly updates and displays textures while optimizing for performance by only repacking when necessary.\n\nif self.isolate:\n            # If we're currently showing an isolated texture, refresh\n            # that display so we get its size right.
