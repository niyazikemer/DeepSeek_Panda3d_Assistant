  "content": "The preceding content discusses performance optimization techniques in Panda3D when dealing with frequent text updates, such as avoiding unnecessary calls to `TextNode.set_text()` or using configuration settings like `text-flatten 0` to potentially improve update speed at the cost of more meshes.\n\nIf you have a lot of different glyphs, Panda may spend more effort garbage collecting used glyphs in order to conserve texture memory. You can increase the default texture size to improve the performance of this, for example:\n\ntext-page-size 512 512",
