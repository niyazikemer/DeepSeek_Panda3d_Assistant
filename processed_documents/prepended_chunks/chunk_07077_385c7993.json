  "content": "This chunk is situated within a section discussing the management of texture sizes in Panda3D, specifically addressing how the choice of texture dimensions affects visual clarity rather than on-screen size. It also introduces the concept of padded textures as an efficient solution for handling non-power-of-two resolutions, such as those encountered when playing movies. The context pertains to optimizing performance and image quality while adhering to hardware constraints related to texture dimensions.\n\nNote that the size you choose for the texture image has nothing to do with the size or shape of the texture image onscreen--that's controlled by the size and shape of the polygon you apply it to. Making a texture image larger won't make it appear larger onscreen, but it will tend to make it crisper and more detailed. Similarly, making a texture smaller will tend to make it fuzzier.\n\nPadded Textures\n\nSometimes, you need to load data into a texture every frame. The most common example is when you're playing a movie. Let's say, for example, that the movie is encoded at 640x480 at 30fps. Neither of those dimensions is a power-of-two. It would theoretically be possible for Panda3D to rescale the image to 512x512, but it would have to do it 30 times per second, which is too expensive to be practical.",
