  "content": "The chunk introduces Python coroutines as functions that can be paused and resumed during asynchronous operations, supported by Panda3D's task system. It explains their use in creating lag-free applications with simpler code.\n\nCoroutines\n\npython\n\nCoroutines are a special kind of function introduced in Python 3.5 that can be temporarily suspended, pending the completion of an asynchronous operation, to be resumed after this operation is complete. Panda3D's task system has full support for Python's coroutines.\n\nThis feature can be hard to understand at first, but it is tremendously useful and powerful, since it makes it easy to write lag-free applications. Heavy operations that would otherwise cause the application to lag or hang can be performed in the background without adding significant complexity to the code.\n\nTo turn a regular function into a coroutine, it is marked with the async keyword. The await keyword can then be used within the function to pause it while some asynchronous operation runs in the background. In the meantime, other parts of the application can continue to run, eliminating any lag that may otherwise manifest itself.",
