  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a method within the `GarbageReport` class that generates a textual representation of garbage cycles. This method iterates through detected garbage objects, processes their attributes, and constructs a string (`cycleBySyntax`) to illustrate object hierarchies, aiding in debugging by showing how these objects form cycles that prevent proper garbage collection.\n\n**Context:**\n\nThis code is situated within a method responsible for converting detected garbage cycles into a human-readable format. The loop processes each object in the specified range, skipping certain indices and building a string that represents the class hierarchy and member relationships of the garbage objects. This helps identify how these objects form cycles, which is crucial for debugging memory leaks caused by undestroyed references.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe code chunk is part of a method in the `GarbageReport` class that converts detected garbage cycles into a human-readable string representation.
