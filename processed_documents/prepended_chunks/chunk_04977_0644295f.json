  "content": "This code is part of the `oobe` method in the `ShowBase` class. It sets up an \"out-of-body\" camera mode, which allows for a special perspective where the camera node moves freely as if detached from its normal position, providing a trackball-style navigation experience.\n\ncam.setInitialState(t.getState())\n        cam.setCameraMask(~PandaNode.getOverallBit())\n\n        self.showVertices = self.cam.attachNewNode(cam)\n        dr.setCamera(self.showVertices)\n\n    def oobe(self, cam = None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Enable a special \"out-of-body experience\" mouse-interface\n        mode.  This can be used when a \"god\" camera is needed; it\n        moves the camera node out from under its normal node and sets\n        the world up in trackball state.  Button events are still sent\n        to the normal mouse action node (e.g. the DriveInterface), and\n        mouse events, if needed, may be sent to the normal node by\n        holding down the Control key.",
