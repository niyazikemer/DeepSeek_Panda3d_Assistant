  "content": "The chunk provides an overview of the **Advanced Mode** section within a document explaining the MayaPandaTool exporter, highlighting its benefits for customizing and managing exporting settings in Maya, including saving preferences via XML files.\n\nAdvanced Mode\n\nFor viewing the video tutorial click here\n\nIn the beginning Simple Mode should cover the basics of single file exporting. However, once you\u2019ve had to load the application a few times and enter the same settings over and over again, it\u2019s probably time to move on to using the Advanced Mode Tab.\n\nAside from allowing you to have greater control over what specifically gets exported out of a particular Maya scene, this tab allows you to save these options and settings for later use. Also, since everyone has a different set of default exporter options and locations the application allows you to save and load a preferences XML file to load each time the application is launched.",
