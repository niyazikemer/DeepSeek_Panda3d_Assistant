  "content": "The given code chunk is situated within the `__init__` method of the `ProjectileInterval` class. It handles the scenario where both `wayPoint`, `timeToWayPoint`, and `endZ` parameters are provided. The purpose of this code is to compute the projectile's trajectory by first determining the initial velocity based on passing through the specified way point at a given time, then calculating the total duration required for the projectile to reach the target z-coordinate (`endZ`). If it's impossible to reach `endZ`, an error is raised.\n\nassert not wayPoint\n            assert not timeToWayPoint\n            self.startVel = startVel\n            time = calcTimeOfLastImpactOnPlane(self.startPos[2], endZ,\n                                               self.startVel[2], self.zAcc)\n            if time is None:\n                self.notify.error(\n                    'projectile never reaches plane Z=%s' % endZ)\n            self.duration = time\n            self.endPos = None\n        elif None not in (wayPoint, timeToWayPoint, endZ):\n            assert not endPos\n            assert not duration\n            assert not startVel\n            # we pass through wayPoint at time 'timeToWayPoint', and we\n            # stop when we reach endZ\n            self.startVel = calcStartVel(self.startPos, wayPoint,\n                                         timeToWayPoint, self.zAcc)\n            time = calcTimeOfLastImpactOnPlane(\n                self.startPos[2], endZ, self.startVel[2], self.zAcc)\n            if time is None:",
