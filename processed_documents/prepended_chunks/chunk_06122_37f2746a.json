  "content": "The chunk introduces the **CommonFilters** class in Panda3D, which simplifies setting up common image postprocessing operations such as Bloom, Cartoon Inking, Volumetric Lighting, and more.\n\nCommon Image Filters\n\ncpp\n\nNote\n\nSorry, but the CommonFilters and FilterManager classes are implemented in Python and will not be of much use to C++ users.\n\nThe purpose of the ~direct.filter.CommonFilters.CommonFilters class is to make it easy to set up a number of common image postprocessing operations.\n\nImport the class like this:\n\nfrom direct.filter.CommonFilters import CommonFilters\n\nCurrently, the image postprocessing operations supported by CommonFilters are:\n\nBloom Filter - creates a glowing halo around bright objects.\n\nCartoon Inker - draws black lines around 3D objects.\n\nVolumetric Lighting - screen-space method for casting god-rays.\n\nInverted Filter - inverts all colors.\n\nBlur/Sharpen Filter - applies a generic blur or sharpen filter.\n\nAmbient Occlusion - applies a screen-space ambient occlusion filter.\n\nGamma Adjust - applies a gamma adjustment.\n\nsRGB Encode - ensures the image is encoded using the sRGB inverse EOTF.",
