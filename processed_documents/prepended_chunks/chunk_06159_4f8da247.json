  "content": "The .StencilAttrib in Panda3D allows testing and writing to the stencil buffer simultaneously, enabling selective rendering by providing per-pixel masking for objects. This is useful for effects like binary masking, shadowing, and planar reflections.\n\nStencil Attribute\n\nThe .StencilAttrib is used for testing and writing to the stencil buffer. Note that both of these actions can be performed simultaneously with a single StencilAttrib.\n\nThe stencil buffer is an ancillary graphics buffer, in addition to the more well-known color and depth buffers. It provides a per-pixel mask for the rendering pipeline which can be exploited to selectively render objects or parts of objects. Typical applications of the stencil buffer include binary masking, shadowing and planar reflections.\n\nUsually, using the stencil buffer involves creating some objects which are not rendered into the color buffer. Their contribution to the rendered scene is to provide an invisible boundary that can be used to turn color buffer rendering on and off for other objects in the scene. Think of it as a cardboard cut-out through which the world is viewed.",
