  "content": "The chunk pertains to managing event subscriptions in the Messenger class by allowing an object to stop responding to a particular event, ensuring thread safety through locking and updating internal tracking dictionaries.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Acquiring Lock:** The method begins by acquiring a lock to ensure thread-safe modifications of internal data structures.\n2. **Retrieving Object ID:** It fetches the unique messenger ID for the given object using `_getMessengerId`.\n3. **Modifying Event Tracking:** \n   - Checks if the event exists in the callbacks dictionary (`__callbacks`) for the object's ID.\n   - If found, deletes the event from both `__callbacks` and `__objectEvents`, indicating that the object will no longer accept this event.\n4. **Logging Debug Information:** Uses debug logging to inform about the change in subscription status.\n\nThis method is crucial for dynamic event management, allowing objects to selectively ignore events as needed while maintaining data consistency through proper synchronization mechanisms.\n\nacceptorDict[id] = [method, extraArgs, persistent]\n\n            # Remember that this object is listening for this event\n            eventDict = self.__objectEvents.setdefault(id, {})\n            if event not in eventDict:\n                self._storeObject(object)\n                eventDict[event] = None\n        finally:\n            self.lock.release()\n\n    def ignore(self, event, object):\n        \"\"\" ignore(self, string, DirectObject)\n        Make this object no longer respond to this event.\n        It is safe to call even if it was not already accepting\n        \"\"\"\n        if Messenger.notify.getDebug():\n            Messenger.notify.debug(\n                safeRepr(object) + ' (%s)\\n now ignoring: ' % (self._getMessengerId(object), ) + safeRepr(event))\n\n        self.lock.acquire()\n        try:\n            id = self._getMessengerId(object)",
