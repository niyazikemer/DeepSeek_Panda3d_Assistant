  "content": "The provided code chunk is a section from the `FSMInspector.py` file, specifically detailing the `StateInspector` class. The caveat at the beginning addresses known issues when using Tkinter alongside Emacs, a common issue in GUI development with Python and Emacs integration. This note is crucial for developers using the module to avoid unexpected lockups during testing or debugging. Following this, the code imports necessary libraries and defines the `FSMInspector` and `StateInspector` classes, which together provide a graphical interface for inspecting and managing finite state machines (FSMs) in applications. The `__all__` statement ensures only specific classes are exported when importing from this module.\n\n**Context:**\nThis chunk is part of the FSM Inspector module's documentation, highlighting potential issues with Tkinter and Emacs integration, followed by the essential imports and class definitions necessary for inspecting FSMs graphically.\n\nCaveat\n------\n\nThere is an unexplained problem with using Tk and emacs right now which\noccasionally results in everything locking up.  This procedure seems to\navoid the problem for me::\n\n   # Start up the show\n   from direct.showbase.ShowBaseGlobal import *\n\n   # You will see the window and a Tk panel pop open\n\n   # Type a number at the emacs prompt\n   >>> 123\n\n   # At this point everything will lock up and you won't get your prompt back\n\n   # Hit a bunch of Control-C's in rapid succession, in most cases\n   # this will break you out of whatever badness you were in and\n   # from that point on everything will behave normally\n\n\n   # This is how you pop up an inspector\n   import FSMInspector\n   inspector = FSMInspector.FSMInspector(fsm, title = fsm.getName())\n\n\"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ['FSMInspector', 'StateInspector']\n\nfrom direct.tkwidgets.AppShell import AppShell\nfrom tkinter.simpledialog import askstring\nimport Pmw\nimport math\nimport operator\nimport tkinter as tk",
