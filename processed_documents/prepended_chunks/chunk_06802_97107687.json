  "content": "The provided chunk situates within a comprehensive document detailing various configuration variables for a software system. The chunk specifically addresses parameters controlling maximum limits on heap size, vertex data management, network latency simulation, and lens allocation. These settings are critical for managing resource utilization, performance optimization, and testing scenarios within the application.\n\nmuch time has actually elapsed between frames. See\nClockObject::set_dt(). max-heap-size int64 0 If this is nonzero, it is the maximum number of bytes expected to be\nallocated on the heap before we enter report-memory-usage mode\nautomatically. The assumption is that once this limit has been crossed,\nwe must be leaking. max-independent-vertex-data int -1 Specifies the maximum number of bytes of all vertex data that is\nindependent of the paging system. This is an initial buffer before\nmax-ram-vertex-data, specifically designed for vertex datas that are\ndynamic in nature and may change size or be created and destroyed\nfrequently. max-lag double 0.0 This represents the time in seconds by which to artificially lag\ninbound messages. It is useful to test a game's tolerance of network\nlatency. max-lenses int 100 Specifies an upper limit on the maximum number of lenses and the\nmaximum lens index number) that may be associated with a single",
