  "content": "The chunk provides an introduction to embedded text properties in Panda3D, explaining how to define custom text formatting options by creating .TextProperties objects with specific attributes like color, font, slant, shadow, alignment, and wordwrap.\n\nEmbedded Text Properties\n\nIt's possible to change text properties in the middle of a paragraph. To do this, you must first define the different kinds of text properties you might want to change to, and give each one a name; then you can embed special characters in your text string to switch these predefined text properties in and out.\n\nDefining your text properties\n\nYou can create any number of .TextProperties objects. Each of these can store a different set of text properties, any of the text properties that you can set directly on a .TextNode. These include the per-character attributes such as font, color, shadow, and slant, as well as per-line formatting properties such as alignment and wordwrap.\n\ntpRed = TextProperties()\ntpRed.setTextColor(1, 0, 0, 1)\ntpSlant = TextProperties()\ntpSlant.setSlant(0.3)\ntpRoman = TextProperties()\ntpRoman.setFont(cmr12)",
