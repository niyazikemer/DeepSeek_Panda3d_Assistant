  "content": "The renderer section explains how particle appearances are defined in a particle system. This follows an introduction to factories and emitters, and precedes details about the particle system's control parameters. It is part of a comprehensive guide covering all essential components for creating and managing particle effects in Panda3D.\n\nRenderer\n\nThe renderer is used to specify how the particle appears on screen.\n\nAvailable renderers\n\n.GeomParticleRenderer: displays each particle in the shape of a selected PandaNode\n\n.LineParticleRenderer: displays each particle as a line\n\n.PointParticleRenderer: displays each particle as a point\n\n.SparkleParticleRenderer displays each particle as a plus (+)\n\n.SpriteParticleRenderer: displays each particle as a sprite\n\nEach renderer is declared in a separate .h file with the same name as the renderer. For example: GeomParticleRenderer is declared in geomParticleRenderer.h",
