  "content": "The provided chunk is situated within a section discussing **Nonstandard Texture Sizes** in Panda3D. It explains how to configure the application to use non-power-of-two textures by setting `textures-power-2 none` or enabling auto-detection with `textures-auto-power-2 #t`, while also cautioning about potential compatibility issues when using multiple windows or video cards that don't truly support non-power-of-two textures.\n\ntextures-power-2 none\n\nYou can also attempt to have panda detect your video card's capabilities automatically, using this command:\n\ntextures-auto-power-2 #t\n\nIf this variable is true, then panda will wait until you open a window, and then ask the window's driver if the driver supports non-power-of-two textures. If so, then the config variable textures-power-2 will automatically be adjusted. In this way, you can configure Panda3D to use non-power-of-two textures if they are available.\n\nCaution\n\nThere is a potential pitfall when using textures-auto-power-2. If you open a window that supports non-power-of-two textures, panda will switch into textures-power-2 none mode. If you then open a second window using a different video card which doesn't support non-power-of-two textures, then panda will have no choice but to print an error message.\n\nNote",
