  "content": "The chunk introduces 3-D textures in Panda3D after discussing ordinary 2-D texture maps. It explains that a 3-D texture is volumetric, with dimensions u, v, and w, requiring special coordinates for application. This section sets the stage for further details on applying, storing, and using these textures in specific applications like scientific imaging or procedural generation.\n\n3-D Textures\n\nSo far, we have only talked about ordinary 2-D texture maps. Panda3D also supports the concept of a 3-D texture map. This is a volumetric texture: in addition to a height and a width, it also has a depth:\n\nThe 3-D texture image is solid all the way through; if we were to cut away part of the cube we would discover that the checkerboard pattern continues within:\n\nThis is true no matter what shape we carve out of the cube:\n\nIn addition to the usual u and v texture dimensions, a 3-D texture also has w. In order to apply a 3-D texture to geometry, you will therefore need to have 3-D texture coordinates (u, v, w) on your geometry, instead of just the ordinary (u, v).",
