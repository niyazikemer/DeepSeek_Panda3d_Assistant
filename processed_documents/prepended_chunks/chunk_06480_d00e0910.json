  "content": "The chunk provides specific instructions on how to ensure proper garbage collection for custom class instances in Panda3D by detailing two important steps: calling `~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.delete()` on all Actors to remove animations and joints from memory, and setting all Intervals, Sequences, and Parallels to None to prevent them from retaining references that could hinder garbage collection. These steps are part of a broader guide aimed at helping developers manage memory efficiently in their Panda3D applications by ensuring all components related to custom classes are properly cleaned up.\n\nCall ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.delete() on all Actors \u2013 Just calling ~.NodePath.remove_node() on an Actor isn\u2019t enough. Calling ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.delete() will remove ties to animations, exposed joints, and so on to ensure that all the extra components of the Actor are removed from memory as well.\n\nSet all Intervals, Sequences, and Parallels equal to None \u2013 It\u2019s very common for Intervals, Sequences, and Parallels to retain references to something in the class and prevent the class instance from being cleaned up. To be safe, it\u2019s best to remove the references to these Intervals so that they get cleaned up themselves and any references they have to the class are removed.",
