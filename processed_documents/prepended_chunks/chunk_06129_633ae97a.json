  "content": "The chunk describes the key parameters of the High Dynamic Range (HDR) filter in Panda3D, which are used to configure the behavior and appearance of light rays in an HDR rendering setup.\n\ncaster - NodePath that indicates the origin of the rays. Usually, you would pass your light, and create a sun billboard which is reparented to the light's NodePath.\n\nnumsamples - Number of samples. The more samples you use, the slower the effect will be, but you will have smoother light rays. Note that using a fuzzy billboarded dot instead of a hard-edged sphere as light caster can help with smoothing the end result, too. This value does not need to be a power-of-two, it can be any positive number. Default: 32\n\ndensity - This defines the length of the rays. The default value of 5.0 is probably too high for many purposes, usually a value between 0.5 and 1.0 works best. This also depends on the number of samples and exposure you've chosen, though. Default: 5.0\n\ndecay - Decay makes rays gradually decrease in brightness. The default value of 0.1 is not well chosen and makes the rays very short! Usually, this a value close to 1.0, like 0.98. Default: 0.1",
