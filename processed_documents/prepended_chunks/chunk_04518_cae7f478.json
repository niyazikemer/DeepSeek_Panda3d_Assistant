  "content": "The chunk of code is part of a memory leak detection mechanism that monitors object containers over time. It iterates through each container identified by an ID to check for consistent size increases across multiple measurement periods, logging a warning if detected.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Loop Through Containers:** For each `objId`, the code attempts to retrieve the corresponding container using `getContainerByIdGen(objId)`.\n\n2. **Exception Handling:** If an exception occurs during retrieval (e.g., container not found), it logs a debug message indicating the issue.\n\n3. **Check for Leak Indicators:** If no exception, it checks if the container's size has increased consistently over three measurement periods.\n\n4. **Log Warning:** If consistent growth is detected, a warning message is generated and logged, detailing the object name, type, previous size, and current contents.\n\n**Code Integration:**\n\nThis code is inserted into the `_checkForLeaks` method or a related function that processes leak check results. It iterates over each monitored container ID, checks for size trends, and alerts if potential leaks are detected.\n\ntry:\n                                        for container in self._leakDetector.getContainerByIdGen(objId):\n                                            yield None\n                                    except Exception:\n                                        # TODO\n                                        self.notify.debug('caught exception in getContainerByIdGen (2)')\n                                    else:\n                                        msg = ('%s (%s) consistently increased in size over the last '\n                                               '3 periods (%s items at last measurement, current contents: %s)' %\n                                               (name, itype(container), idx2id2len[self._index][objId],\n                                                fastRepr(container, maxLen=CheckContainers.ReprItems)))\n                                        self.notify.warning(msg)\n                                    yield None",
