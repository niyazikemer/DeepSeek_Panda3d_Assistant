  "content": "The chunk provides an introduction to Panda3D's scene graph system, explaining how it differs from simple 3D engines by using a hierarchical tree structure of nodes (e.g., ModelNode, GeomNode) for rendering.\n\nThe Scene Graph\n\nThe Scene Graph: a Tree of Nodes\n\nMany simple 3D engines maintain a list of 3D models to render every frame. In these simple engines, one must allocate a 3D model (or load it from disk), and then insert it into the list of models to render. The model is not \"visible\" to the renderer until it is inserted into the list.\n\nPanda3D is slightly more sophisticated. Instead of maintaining a list of objects to render, it maintains a tree of objects to render. An object is not visible to the renderer until it is inserted into the tree.\n\nThe tree consists of objects of class ~.PandaNode. This is actually a superclass for a number of other classes: ~.ModelNode, ~.GeomNode, ~.LightNode, and so forth. Throughout this manual, it is common for us to refer to objects of these classes as simply nodes, and the tree that is being made up by these nodes is known as the scene graph.",
