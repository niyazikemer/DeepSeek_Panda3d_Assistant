  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a section discussing NodePath methods and their corresponding node-specific operations in Panda3D. The chunk specifically focuses on camera node methods, providing C++ examples such as `set_ lens()` and `get_camera_mask()`. It emphasizes the importance of converting NodePaths to nodes before invoking specific node methods, reinforcing proper method invocation patterns for developers working with Panda3D's scene graph system. This section appears later in the document, following discussions on general NodePath functionality and specialized node types like LODNode.\n\n// CAMERA NODE METHODS:\nmyNodePath.node()->set_lens(new PerspectiveLens());\nmyNodePath.node()->get_camera_mask();\n\nAlways remember: when you invoke a method of ~.NodePath, you are actually performing an operation on the node to which it points.\n\nIn the example above, we call node-methods by first converting the NodePath into a node, and then immediately calling the node-method. This is the recommended style.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nmodel-files common-state-changes manipulating-a-piece-of-a-model searching-scene-graph instancing level-of-detail",
