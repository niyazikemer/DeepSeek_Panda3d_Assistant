  "content": "The chunk describes advanced configuration options in Panda3D related to rendering optimizations, performance tuning, and experimental features such as portal culling, alpha handling, and texture-based alpha scaling.\n\ncrash. Do not set this unless you know what you are doing. allow-portal-cull bool 0 Set this true to enable portal clipping. This will enable the\nrenderer to cull more objects that are clipped if not in the current\nlist of portals. This is still somewhat experimental. allow-unrelated-wrt bool 1 Set this true to allow unrelated NodePaths (that is, nodes which\nhave no common ancestor) to be adjusted relative to each other. If true,\nthese will be treated as if they had a common node above their top\nnodes. alpha-bits int 0 (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded The minimum number of alpha buffer bits requested. alpha-scale-via-texture bool 1 When this is true, Panda will try to implement ColorScaleAttribs\nthat affect alpha by creating an additional Texture layer over the\ngeometry with a uniform alpha scale applied everywhere, if there is at\nleast one available Texture slot available on the multitexture pipeline.\nSet this false to avoid this trickery, so that texturing is only enabled",
