  "content": "The `addTrack` method is part of managing track lists within an Interval management system. It allows for complex scheduling by defining how each interval in a track should start relative to others, either at the end or start of the previous interval or from the beginning of the track itself.\n\n**Context:**  \nThe `addTrack` method is used within the Track class (or related) to handle lists of intervals with specific timing relationships. It processes tuples defining delays and intervals, allowing each interval's start time to be relative to another interval's end, start, or the track's beginning, thus enabling flexible scheduling.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe `addTrack` method is a key function in managing track lists within an Interval management system. It processes tuples that define how intervals are scheduled, allowing each interval to start relative to the end or start of another interval or from the track's beginning. This enables precise and flexible control over interval scheduling.\n\ndef addTrack(self, trackList, name, relTime, relTo, duration):\n        # Adds a \"track list\".
