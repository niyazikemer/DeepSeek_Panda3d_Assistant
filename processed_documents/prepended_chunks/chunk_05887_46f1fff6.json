  "content": "The provided chunk is an introductory section in a document about writing 3D models in Panda3D, specifically discussing two native file formats: Egg and BAM files. The chunk explains that Egg files are ASCII-based, human-readable, and designed for ease of modification and backward compatibility, while BAM files are binary, efficient for loading but less compatible across different Panda versions. This context introduces the key concepts of model storage in Panda3D, setting the stage for further discussion on their use and conversion.\n\nWriting 3D Models out to Disk\n\nPanda has two native file formats for models.\n\nEgg files (with the extension .egg) are written in an ASCII human readable format. The egg format is designed to be easy to read and modify if necessary, and easy to write a convert into from another third-party format. Also, the egg format is intended to be backward-compatible from all future versions of Panda3D, so if you have an egg file that Panda can load now, it should always be able to load that file. (Well, we can't really make guarantees, but this is what we shoot for.) See parsing-and-generating-egg-files for more information about the egg format.\n\nBAM Files\n\nBecause of the way the egg syntax is designed, an egg file might be very large, sometimes many times larger than the file it was converted from. It can also sometimes take several seconds for Panda to load a large egg file.",
