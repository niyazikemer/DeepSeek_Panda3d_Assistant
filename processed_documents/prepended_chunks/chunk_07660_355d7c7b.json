  "content": "The document outlines the Panda3D rendering process using four key classes: GraphicsPipe, GraphicsEngine, GraphicsStateGuardian, and GraphicsOutput. The chunk highlights the importance of understanding these components for advanced window and buffer management, introducing topics like multithreaded pipelines and stereo display regions to enhance rendering control.\n\n**Context:** This section delves into managing windows and buffers in Panda3D by exploring how various classes interact, essential for users seeking advanced rendering techniques beyond basic operations.\n\nAt some point, however, you may wish to understand more deeply how to manage your windows and buffers, and to do this it will help you to understand how everything is connected together.\n\nmultithreaded-render-pipeline introducing-graphics-classes graphics-pipe creating-windows-and-buffers display-regions creating-mouse-watchers clearing-display-regions 2d-display-region stereo-display-regions multi-pass-rendering controlling-render-order supported-renderer-features",
