  "content": "The chunk sits within the `goTo` method of the `Mopath` class, which handles moving and orienting a node along a motion path. Specifically, it implements face-forward functionality: when enabled (`self.fFaceForward`), it calculates where the node should look as it moves along the path by either looking ahead in parametric time or using the tangent vector at the current position to determine the direction of movement.\n\n# Look at a point a bit ahead in parametric time.\n                t = min(self.playbackTime + self.faceForwardDelta, self.xyzNurbsCurve.getMaxT())\n                lookPoint = Point3()\n                self.xyzNurbsCurve.getPoint(t, lookPoint)\n                if self.faceForwardNode:\n                    self.faceForwardNode.setPos(lookPoint)\n            else:\n                self.xyzNurbsCurve.getTangent(self.playbackTime, self.tangentVec)\n                lookPoint = self.posPoint + self.tangentVec",
