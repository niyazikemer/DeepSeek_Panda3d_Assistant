  "content": "The chunk introduces the fundamental concepts of tinting and recoloring 3D models within the context of Panda3D, emphasizing how color attributes are determined by modeling software like Max or Maya, including flat colors, vertex colors, and default white when no color is specified. This sets the stage for explaining how these color attributes can be overridden or modified in Panda3D using specific methods.\n\nTinting and Recoloring\n\nColor and the Model Loader\n\nWhen you create a 3D model in Max, Maya, or the like, you can color the model right in the modeling program. I'm not talking about using a texture. I'm talking about just setting a single color to the model as a whole. This is called a \"flat color\". These art programs also allow you to \"paint vertex colors\": you can color each vertex of the model a different color. Of course, sometimes you do neither, in which case the model is just white.\n\nEvery model you load already has a color attribute. Color Attributes are usually not created by the programmer explicitly, they're usually created by the model loader only. There are three possible color attributes created by the model loader:",
