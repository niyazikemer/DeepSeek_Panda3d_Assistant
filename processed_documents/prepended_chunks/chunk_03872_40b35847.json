  "content": "The provided code chunk contains two methods within a TaskManager class implementation: `getCurrentTask()` and `hasTaskChain()`. These methods are part of a larger system designed to manage tasks, likely in a multithreaded environment. The `getCurrentTask()` method retrieves the currently executing task for the current thread, while the `hasTaskChain()` method checks if a specified task chain has been defined or set up within the task manager. Both methods are used to introspect and manage the state of tasks and their associated chains in the system.\n\nreturn Thread.getCurrentThread().getCurrentTask()\n\n    def hasTaskChain(self, chainName: str) -> bool:\n        \"\"\" Returns true if a task chain with the indicated name has\n        already been defined, or false otherwise.  Note that\n        setupTaskChain() will implicitly define a task chain if it has\n        not already been defined, or modify an existing one if it has,\n        so in most cases there is no need to check this method\n        first. \"\"\"\n\n        return self.mgr.findTaskChain(chainName) is not None",
