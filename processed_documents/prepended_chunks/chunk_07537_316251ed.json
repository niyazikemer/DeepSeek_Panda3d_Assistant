  "content": "The chunk describes the setup and activation process for linear mode fog nodes in the scene graph, focusing on how their position and orientation define the fog's origin and direction. It explains that in exponential mode, these factors are irrelevant but highlights the importance of activating the fog by calling set_fog() on a NodePath to determine which parts of the scene will be affected.\n\nThe position of a .Fog node in the scene graph does not determine which objects the fog affects, it determines the origin and direction of the fog when it is in linear mode. When a fog node is in exponential mode its position and orientation in the scene graph are irrelevant. Either way, a .Fog node must be activated by calling nodePath.set_fog(fogNode) <.NodePath.set_fog> on some .NodePath in the scene graph. Which .NodePath you call the ~.NodePath.set_fog method on determines which parts of the scene will be fogged: that .NodePath and all its children.\n\nLinear Fog\n\nThis is the default mode. In this mode the position and orientation of a .Fog node are important. A linear-mode .Fog node must first be parented into the scene graph, then activated by calling set_fog(fogNode) <.NodePath.set_fog> on some .NodePath in the scene graph.\n\nSetup a linear fog node at the origin:\n\npython",
