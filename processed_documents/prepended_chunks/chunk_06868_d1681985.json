  "content": "The chunk discusses configuration settings related to vertex animation alignment optimization and LODNode geometry fitting within switch-out distances.\n\nensure that each child's geometry fits entirely within the radius\ndefined by its switch-out distance. When it is false, LODNodes may have\nany switch in and out distances, regardless of the actual size of their\ngeometry. This test is only made in NDEBUG mode (the variable is ignored\nin a production build). vertex-animation-align-16 bool 1 If this is true, then animated vertices will be created with\n4-component floats and aligned to 16-byte boundaries, to allow efficient\nvectorization (e.g. SSE2) operations when computing animations. If this\nis false, animated vertices will be packed as tightly as possible, in\nthe normal way, which will optimize the amount of memory that must be\nsent to the graphics card, but prevent the use of SSE2 to calculate\nanimation. This does not affect unanimated vertices, which are always\npacked tightly. This also impacts only vertex formats created within",
