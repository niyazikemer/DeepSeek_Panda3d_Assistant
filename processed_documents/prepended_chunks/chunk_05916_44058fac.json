  "content": "The chunk situates within a discussion of the hierarchical structure of Panda3D's scene graph. It explains how object positions are relative to their parent nodes, rendering attributes propagate through child nodes unless overridden, and the importance of bounding boxes for efficient frustum and occlusion culling.\n\nPositions of objects are specified relative to their parent in the tree. For example, if you have a 3D model of a hat, you might want to specify that it always stays five units above a 3D model of a certain person's head. Insert the hat as a child of the head, and set the position of the hat to (0,0,5).\n\nWhen models are arranged in a tree, any rendering attributes you assign to a node will propagate to its children. For example, if you specify that a given node should be rendered with depth fog, then its children will also be rendered with depth fog, unless you explicitly override at the child level.\n\nPanda3D generates bounding boxes for each node in the tree. A good organizational hierarchy can speed frustum and occlusion culling. If the bounding box of an entire branch is outside the frustum, there is no need to examine the children.",
