  "content": "The chunk describes the process of extracting and examining existing geometry data in a model, with a focus on understanding the unpredictability of vertex ordering due to optimization. This is situated within a broader discussion of techniques for accessing and manipulating geometry data in Panda3D, including methods for reading vertices and handling different primitive types.\n\nReading existing geometry data\n\nYou can fairly easily extract and examine or operate on the vertices for an existing model, although you should be aware that the order in which the vertices appear in a model is undefined. There is no correlation between the order in which vertices are listed in an egg file, and the order in which they will appear in the resulting loaded model. Panda may rearrange the vertices, or even add or remove vertices, as needed to optimize the model for rendering performance. Even from one session to the next, the vertices might come out in a different order.",
