These settings control aspects such as cache efficiency, type verification, interval function ordering, and LOD node validation, all of which are crucial for maintaining system integrity and optimizing resource management.\n\npointerwise equal. This may improve caching performance, but also adds\nadditional overhead to maintain the cache, including the need to check\nfor a composition cycle in the cache. upload-stack-dump bool 0 DConfig use-movietexture undefined #t (from Config.prc); hardcoded validate-subparts bool 1 variable-dump-on-exception-init bool 0 Unstable; intended to dump variables when an exception is\ninvoked. verify-dcast bool 1 Set this to true to verify that every attempted DCAST operation in\nfact references the correct type, or false otherwise.
