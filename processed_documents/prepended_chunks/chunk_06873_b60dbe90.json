  "content": "The provided document is a comprehensive list of configuration settings and documentation strings (docstrings) for a software system, likely related to graphics or game development, given mentions of vertex buffers, float precision, and virtual filesystems. The chunk focuses on specific configuration variables related to the management of vertex buffer storage when evicted from RAM, the use of 64-bit floats for vertices (which is generally discouraged), and the case sensitivity of the Virtual File System (VFS). These settings are important for optimizing performance and ensuring consistency across different operating systems.\n\nfile which is created for saving vertex buffers that have been evicted\nfrom RAM. A uniquifying sequence number and filename extension will be\nappended to this string. vertices-float64 bool 0 When this is true, the default float format for vertices will be a\n64-bit double-precision float, instead of the normal 32-bit\nsingle-precision float. This must be set at static init time to have the\nbroadest effect. You almost never want to set this true, since current\nhardware does not support double-precision vertices, and setting this\nwill just require the driver to downsample the vertices at load time,\nmaking everything slower. vfs-case-sensitive bool 1 Set this true to make the VirtualFileSystem present the native\nOS-provided filesystem as if it were a case-sensitive file system, even\nif it is not (e.g. on Windows). This variable has no effect if the\nnative filesystem is already case-sensitive, and it has no effect on",
