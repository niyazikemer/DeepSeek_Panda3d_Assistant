Note if this variable is changed at runtime, you\nmay need to reload textures explicitly in order to change their visible\nproperties. texture-filter list Names one or more external libraries that should be loaded for the\npurposes of performing texture filtering. This variable may be repeated\nseveral times. As in load-display, the actual library filename is\nderived by prefixing 'lib' to the specified name. texture-magfilter enum linear This specifies the default magfilter that is applied to a texture in\nthe absence of a specific magfilter setting. Normally this is 'linear'\n(since mipmapping does not apply to magfilters). This does not apply to\ndepth textures.
