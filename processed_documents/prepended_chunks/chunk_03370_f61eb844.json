  "content": "This code chunk is part of a larger system for managing direct manipulation and user interface elements in a 3D graphics application built with Panda3D. Specifically, the code initializes on-screen text elements (`activeParentReadout` and `directMessageReadout`) that display information to the user during interaction. These readouts are styled and positioned for visibility but are initially hidden until needed. The chunk appears within the initialization or setup phase of a class responsible for handling direct manipulation contexts in the application, where UI feedback is crucial for user guidance.\n\nself.activeParentReadout = OnscreenText.OnscreenText(\n            pos = (0.1, 0.16), bg=Vec4(0, 0, 0, .2), style = 3,\n            fg = (1, 1, 1, 1), scale = 0.05, align = TextNode.ALeft,\n            mayChange = 1, font = self.font)\n        # Make sure readout is never lit or drawn in wireframe\n        useDirectRenderStyle(self.activeParentReadout)\n        self.activeParentReadout.reparentTo(hidden)\n\n        self.directMessageReadout = OnscreenText.OnscreenText(\n            pos = (0.1, -0.1), bg=Vec4(0, 0, 0, .2), style = 3,\n            fg = (1, 1, 1, 1), scale = 0.05, align = TextNode.ALeft,\n            mayChange = 1, font = self.font)\n        # Make sure readout is never lit or drawn in wireframe\n        useDirectRenderStyle(self.directMessageReadout)\n        self.directMessageReadout.reparentTo(hidden)",
