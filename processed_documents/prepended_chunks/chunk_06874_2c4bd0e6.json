  "content": "This chunk discusses the configuration settings `vfs-implicit-mf` and `vfs-implicit-pz`, which control how the VirtualFileSystem automatically mounts multifiles as directories and handles implicit decompression of `.pz` archives.\n\nif it is not (e.g. on Windows). This variable has no effect if the\nnative filesystem is already case-sensitive, and it has no effect on\nmounted multifile systems, which are always case-sensitive. vfs-implicit-mf bool 0 When this is true, the VirtualFileSystem will automatically mount\nmultifiles on-the-fly when they are used as directories. For instance,\nopening the file /c/files/foo.mf/dirname/mytex.jpg will implicitly\nretrieve a file named 'dirname/mytex.jpg' within the multifile\n/c/files/foo.mf, even if the multifile has not already been mounted.\nThis makes all of your multifiles act like directories. vfs-implicit-pz bool 1 When this is true, the VirtualFileSystem will pretend a named file\nexists even if it doesn't, as long as a filename with the same name and\nthe additional extension .pz does exist. In this case, the\nVirtualFileSystem will implicitly open the .pz file and decompress it",
