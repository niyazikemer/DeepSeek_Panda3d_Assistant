  "content": "The `InputState` class is designed for managing and tracking the on/off states of various input events. It allows tasks to poll input states without directly listening for events, supporting forced state management through tokens, and includes standard input sources like WASD, QE, ArrowKeys, Keyboard, and Mouse. The class provides methods for watching events, forcing states, releasing inputs, and handling notifications, with direct object integration for event management.\n\nclass InputState(DirectObject.DirectObject):\n    \"\"\"\n    InputState is for tracking the on/off state of some events.\n    The initial usage is to watch some keyboard keys so that another\n    task can poll the key states.  By the way, in general polling is\n    not a good idea, but it is useful in some situations.
