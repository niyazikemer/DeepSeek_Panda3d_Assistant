This module imports essential classes and functions from the Panda3D library (e.g., `AnimBundleNode`, `Character`, etc.) as well as other necessary components for handling animations and model rendering in a 3D environment. The purpose of this code is to provide the foundational setup required for creating, managing, and animating actors within a 3D application using Panda3D tools.\n\n\"\"\"Actor module: contains the Actor class.\n\nSee the :ref:`loading-actors-and-animations` page in the Programming Guide\nto learn more about loading animated models.\n\"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ['Actor']\n\nfrom panda3d.core import (\n    AnimBundleNode,\n    AnimControlCollection,\n    Character,\n    ConfigVariableBool,\n    DecalEffect,\n    Filename,\n    GlobPattern,\n    LineStream,\n    LoaderOptions,\n    LODNode,\n    ModelNode,\n    MovingPartBase,\n    MovingPartMatrix,\n    NodePath,\n    PandaNode,\n    PartBundle,\n    PartSubset,\n    Point3,\n    TransformState,\n    Vec3,\n    autoBind,\n)\nfrom panda3d.core import Loader as PandaLoader\nfrom direct.showbase.DirectObject import DirectObject\nfrom direct.showbase.Loader import Loader\nfrom direct.directnotify import DirectNotifyGlobal\nimport warnings",
