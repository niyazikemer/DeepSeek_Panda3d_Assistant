  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a guide explaining how to implement client-server communication using Panda3D. The section describes server-side functionality, including broadcasting messages to all connected clients, terminating active connections, and deactivating the server's listener. It serves as an extension of the server setup process before transitioning into the client connection procedure.\n\n# broadcast a message to all clients\nmyPyDatagram = myNewPyDatagram()  # build a datagram to send\nfor aClient in activeConnections:\n    cWriter.send(myPyDatagram,aClient)\n\nFinally, the server may terminate a connection by removing it from the QueuedConnectionReader's responsibility. It may also deactivate its listener so that no more connections are received.\n\n# terminate connection to all clients\n\nfor aClient in activeConnections:\n    cReader.removeConnection(aClient)\nactiveConnections = []\n\n# close down our listener\ncManager.closeConnection(tcpSocket)\n\nConnecting with a client",
