  "content": "The provided chunk serves as an introductory comment or docstring within the `GravityWalker.py` module. It succinctly summarizes the purpose and scope of the `GravityWalker` class, which is designed to handle avatar movement controls in a 3D environment. The chunk explains what the walker control system includes (collision detection, input handling, and avatar movement) and explicitly states what it does not include (sound effects and animations). This context helps developers quickly understand the module's functionality and limitations when searching for relevant information or integrating the class into larger systems.\n\n\"\"\"\nGravityWalker.py is for avatars.\n\nA walker control such as this one provides:\n\n- creation of the collision nodes\n- handling the keyboard and mouse input for avatar movement\n- moving the avatar\n\nit does not:\n\n- play sounds\n- play animations",
