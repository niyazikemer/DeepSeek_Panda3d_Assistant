  "content": "The document introduces a Python package designed to simplify setting up a Panda environment for interactive prototyping. It explains how importing specific modules creates a ShowBase instance, initializing a graphical window and scene graph. The most commonly used module is DirectStart, which provides a quick setup by importing ShowBase and creating an instance of it.\n\n\"\"\"\nThis package contains modules to quickly set up a Panda environment for\nquick prototyping in the interactive Python shell.  Merely importing\none of these modules will create a :class:`.ShowBase` instance, opening\na graphical window and setting up the scene graph.\n\nThe most commonly used module from this package is :mod:`.DirectStart`,\nimporting which executes the following code::\n\n   from direct.showbase.ShowBase import ShowBase\n   base = ShowBase()\n\"\"\"",
