This ensures that the application is ready for user interaction immediately upon initialization.\n\nvariable = self.severity,\n                                        command = self.setActiveSeverity)\n        self.spamSeverity.pack(fill = X)\n        # Pack frames\n        framePane.pack(expand = 1, fill = BOTH)\n        mainFrame.pack(expand = 1, fill = BOTH)\n        # Get listbox\n        listbox = self.categoryList.component('listbox')\n        # Bind updates to arrow buttons\n        listbox.bind('<KeyRelease-Up>', self.setActivePandaCategory)\n        listbox.bind('<KeyRelease-Down>', self.setActivePandaCategory)\n        # And grab focus (to allow keyboard navigation)\n        listbox.focus_set()\n        # And set active index (so keypresses will start with index 0)\n        listbox.activate(0)\n        # Select first item\n        self.categoryList.select_set(0)\n        self.setActivePandaCategory()",
