  "content": "This code chunk is situated within a class responsible for managing avatar controls in a game or simulation environment. The specific functionality being addressed here involves debugging indicators used to track the avatar's movement and physics calculations.\n\nThe context of this code is a section where on-screen debugging information is set up, specifically adding a debug indicator named \"posDelta1\" that displays the change in position (`posDelta`) of the avatar node relative to the render frame. This helps in visualizing and debugging the avatar's movement or positional changes within the scene.\n\nIn summary, this code chunk is part of a debugging setup aimed at displaying movement-related information for the avatar, which aids in troubleshooting and ensuring correct physics and control functionality.\n\n#    self.__oldPosDelta=Vec3(posDelta)\n        if __debug__:\n            if self.wantDebugIndicator:\n                onScreenDebug.add(\"posDelta1\",\n                    self.avatarNodePath.getPosDelta(render).pPrintValues())",
