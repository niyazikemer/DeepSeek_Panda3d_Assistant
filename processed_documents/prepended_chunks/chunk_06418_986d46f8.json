  "content": "The chunk discusses applying a cube map as an environment map to a teapot using `TexGenAttrib.MEyeCubeMap`, highlighting its similarity to sphere mapping but noting cube maps' advantage in handling dynamic viewpoints. It then demonstrates switching to `MWorldCubeMap` to vary the reflection based on camera movement, illustrating how cube maps offer more flexibility than sphere maps for dynamic reflections.\n\ntex = loader.loadCubeMap('streetscene_cube_#.jpg')\nteapot.setTexGen(TextureStage.getDefault(), TexGenAttrib.MEyeCubeMap)\nteapot.setTexture(tex)\n\nAnd the result looks very similar to the sphere map:\n\nIn fact, it looks so similar that one might wonder why we bothered. So far, a cube map looks pretty similar to a sphere map, except that it consumes six times the texture memory. Hardly impressive.\n\nBut as we mentioned earlier <simple-environment-mapping>, there are two problems with sphere maps that cube maps can solve. One of these problems is that the point-of-view is permanently baked into the sphere map. Cube maps don't necessarily have the same problem. In fact, we can solve it with one simple variation:\n\ntex = loader.loadCubeMap('streetscene_cube_#.jpg')\nteapot.setTexGen(TextureStage.getDefault(), TexGenAttrib.MWorldCubeMap)\nteapot.setTexture(tex)",
