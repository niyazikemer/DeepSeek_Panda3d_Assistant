  "content": "The chunk is part of a custom distutils command (`bdist_apps`) implementation for building installers/distributions for Panda3D applications. The chunk defines platform-specific binary magic numbers for identifying Mac OS X executables, followed by a mapping of modules requiring data extraction during distribution packaging. This is used to ensure that necessary application resources are properly bundled into the installer for different platforms.\n\nThe code appears in the section where platform-specific handling and resource management is defined, likely within the `bdist_apps` command implementation, ensuring proper identification of executables and extraction of required assets for distribution.\n\nmacosx_binary_magics = (\n    b'\\xFE\\xED\\xFA\\xCE', b'\\xCE\\xFA\\xED\\xFE',\n    b'\\xFE\\xED\\xFA\\xCF', b'\\xCF\\xFA\\xED\\xFE',\n    b'\\xCA\\xFE\\xBA\\xBE', b'\\xBE\\xBA\\xFE\\xCA',\n    b'\\xCA\\xFE\\xBA\\xBF', b'\\xBF\\xBA\\xFE\\xCA')\n\n# Some dependencies need data directories to be extracted.
