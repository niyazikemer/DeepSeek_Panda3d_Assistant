  "content": "The chunk consists of a series of video lectures by David Rose from Walt Disney VR Studio about advanced topics in Panda3D, focusing on distributed objects, server systems, runtime configurations, collision detection, tools like egg- palettize and interrogate, ODE integration, actor implementation, and plugin design. These lectures are part of a larger collection covering the fundamentals and practical applications of Panda3D, recorded between April 2008 and July 2008, with additional content on plugin flow in August 2010.\n\nDistributedObjects\n\nRecorded April 16, 2008\n\nHow to use Panda's DistributedObject system, for the Python developer.\n\nDistributedObjects and the OTP Server\n\nRecorded April 23, 2008\n\nPanda's DistributedObject system, and how it relates to the VR Studio's OTP Server.\n\nThe OTP Server\n\nRecorded April 30, 2008\n\nWhat's inside the VR Studio's OTP Server (not part of Panda).\n\nThe PRC System\n\nRecorded May 7, 2008\n\nAll about Panda's run-time configuration system.\n\nCollisions\n\nRecorded May 14, 2008\n\nHow to use Panda's built-in collision system, and how it works.\n\negg-palettize\n\nRecorded May 21, 2008\n\nHow to use egg-palettize, and why you'd want to.\n\ninterrogate\n\nRecorded June 4, 2008\n\nHow interrogate works to generate Panda's Python/C++ interface.\n\nODE in Panda\n\nRecorded June 18, 2008\n\nHow Panda's built-in ODE integration is intended to be used.\n\nInside an Actor\n\nRecorded July 2, 2008 How the Actor class is implemented, and how to use it.\n\nPlugin flow",
