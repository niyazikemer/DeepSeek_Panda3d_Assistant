  "content": "This code chunk is part of a larger application that involves managing and displaying graphical data. The specific code appears to adjust the user interface (UI) widgets related to resampling functionality, likely in response to changes in the number of samples being processed by a curve-fitting algorithm. The context suggests an interactive application with real-time updates, possibly for data visualization or editing.\n\nThe chunk adjusts maximum values and sets default states for UI elements based on the number of samples obtained from a `curveFitter` object.\n\nnumSamples = self.curveFitter.getNumSamples()\n        widget = self.getWidget('Resample', 'Points Between Samples')\n        widget.configure(max=numSamples)\n        widget = self.getWidget('Resample', 'Num. Samples')\n        widget.configure(max = 4 * numSamples)\n        widget.set(numSamples, 0)\n        self.fAdjustingValues = 0",
