  "content": "The document discusses various collision shape types in Panda3D's Bullet module. This section describes how to create a compound shape by adding multiple individual shapes to a body node, which is useful for creating complex collision geometries such as a table with a central box and four supporting boxes.\n\nThe Panda3D Bullet module has no specialized class for compound shapes. It automatically creates a compound shape if more than one shape is added to a body node.\n\nThe following code snippet will create such a compound shape, resembling the before mentioned table.\n\npython\n\nshape1 = BulletBoxShape((1.3, 1.3, 0.2))\nshape2 = BulletBoxShape((0.1, 0.1, 0.5))\nshape3 = BulletBoxShape((0.1, 0.1, 0.5))\nshape4 = BulletBoxShape((0.1, 0.1, 0.5))\nshape5 = BulletBoxShape((0.1, 0.1, 0.5))\n\nbodyNP.node().addShape(shape1, TransformState.makePos(Point3(0, 0, 0.1)))\nbodyNP.node().addShape(shape2, TransformState.makePos(Point3(-1, -1, -0.5)))\nbodyNP.node().addShape(shape3, TransformState.makePos(Point3(-1, 1, -0.5)))\nbodyNP.node().addShape(shape4, TransformState.makePos(Point3(1, -1, -0.5)))\nbodyNP.node().addShape(shape5, TransformState.makePos(Point3(1, 1, -0.5)))\n\ncpp",
