  "content": "The document provides instructions and guidance on how to build Panda3D from source, noting improvements in the process over time. It includes steps for downloading the source package, referencing the README.md file for build instructions, and mentions a link to the latest build instructions as well as information about handling dependencies.\n\nBuilding Panda3D from Source\n\nNote that in the past, it was very difficult to build Panda3D. Things have improved. It is now fairly straightforward to download and compile Panda3D. In particular, this is a sensible thing to do if you wish to add some functionality to Panda3D.\n\nTo avoid possible consistency problems, the documentation for building the source is included with the source, not in the manual. Download a source package from the panda website, then look at a file called README.md. It contains instructions for invoking the build system, makepanda.\n\nA link to the latest build instructions can be found here: https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/blob/master/README.md\n\nWhile building you'll get a list of not found dependencies. Further descriptions of those can be found here: Dependencies <thirdparty-licenses>.",
