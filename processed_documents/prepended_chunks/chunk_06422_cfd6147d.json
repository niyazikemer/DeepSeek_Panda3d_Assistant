  "content": "The `DirectScrolledFrame` is a variant of `DirectFrame` in Panda3D's DirectGUI system, designed to display and navigate through a larger virtual canvas than what can fit on screen. It uses scroll bars to allow users to page through content, with parameters like `frameSize` for the visible window and `canvasSize` for the virtual area. Widgets are attached to the virtual canvas via `getCanvas()`, positioned within the defined coordinate range.\n\nDirectScrolledFrame\n\nThe DirectScrolledFrame is a special variant of DirectFrame that allows the user to page through a larger frame than would otherwise fit onscreen. The DirectScrolledFrame consists of a small onscreen frame which is actually a window onto a potentially much larger virtual canvas; the user can scroll through this canvas through the use of one or two DirectScrollBars <directscrollbar> on the right and bottom of the frame.\n\nThe frameSize parameter controls the size and placement of the visible, onscreen frame; use the canvasSize parameter to control the size of the larger virtual canvas.\n\nYou can then parent any widgets you like to the NodePath returned by myFrame.getCanvas() <direct.gui.DirectScrolledFrame.DirectScrolledFrame.getCanvas> The DirectGui items you attach to this canvas NodePath will be visible through the small window; you should position them within the virtual canvas using values within the coordinate range you established via the canvasSize parameter.",
