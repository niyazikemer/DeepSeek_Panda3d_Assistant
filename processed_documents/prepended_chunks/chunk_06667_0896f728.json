  "content": "This chunk provides an overview of the Panda3D physics engine, explaining its capabilities for applying forces to models, including angular or linear forces and viscosity. It highlights the importance of enabling the particle system to utilize the physics engine and outlines the subsequent sections that cover preparing models for physical interactions, applying forces, types of forces, and important notes or caveats related to using the physics engine in Panda3D.\n\nPanda3D Physics Engine\n\nPanda3D has a very basic physics engine that may apply forces to classes. The physics engine can handle angular or linear forces, as well as viscosity. To make use of the physics engine, first enable the particle system. The particle system relies upon the physics engine to move and update particles, so enabling the particle system adds the tasks in the engine that monitor and update the interactions of physics-enabled objects in the scene.\n\nbase.enableParticles()\n\nThe rest of this section will address how to prepare a model for physical interactions and apply forces to the model.\n\nenabling-physics-on-a-node applying-physics-to-a-node types-of-forces notes-and-caveats",
