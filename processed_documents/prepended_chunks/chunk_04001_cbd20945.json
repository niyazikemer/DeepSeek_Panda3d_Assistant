  "content": "The FilterManager class is a part of the buffer management system designed to simplify the creation and handling of render-to-texture buffers, crucial for image postprocessing tasks. This module provides essential functionalities like rendering scenes into textures, managing buffer sizes dynamically, and ensuring proper cleanup. The FilterManager is currently under development with several features pending implementation, such as correct buffer sort order, intermediate layer creation, and handling window resizing effectively. It serves as a key component in the overall graphics processing pipeline, offering a convenient interface for developers to implement image filters efficiently.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nThe FilterManager is a convenience class that helps with the creation\nof render-to-texture buffers for image postprocessing applications.\n\nSee :ref:`generalized-image-filters` for information on how to use this class.\n\nStill need to implement:\n\n* Make sure sort-order of buffers is correct.\n* Matching buffer size to original region instead of original window.\n* Intermediate layer creation.\n* Handling of window clears.\n* Resizing of windows.\n* Do something about window-size roundoff problems.\n\n\"\"\"",
