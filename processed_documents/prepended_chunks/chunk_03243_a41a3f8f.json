  "content": "The code chunk is used in the context of handling mouse motion for rotating a 3D object. When the user moves the mouse from one edge of the display to the opposite edge, it results in a full rotation (360 degrees) of the widget. This functionality is part of the DirectManipulate class's method that manages the relative heading, pitch, and roll adjustments based on mouse movement, scaled by predefined rates to control the sensitivity of the rotation.\n\n```python\n# Mouse motion edge-to-edge causes one full turn via relative HPR adjustments.\nrelHpr(ShowBaseGlobal.direct.widget, ShowBaseGlobal.camera, deltaX * tumbleRate,\n       -deltaY * tumbleRate, 0)\n```\n\n# Mouse motion edge to edge of display region results in one full turn\n        relHpr(ShowBaseGlobal.direct.widget, ShowBaseGlobal.direct.camera, deltaX * tumbleRate,\n               -deltaY * tumbleRate, 0)",
