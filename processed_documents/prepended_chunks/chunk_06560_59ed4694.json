  "content": "This chunk explains how to assign render attributes directly to nodes in Python and C++, discusses convenience functions for common attributes, and introduces the concept of render attribute priorities that affect inheritance.\n\nIt is possible to create these attributes and assign them to a node directly:\n\npython\n\nnodePath.node().setAttrib(attributeObject)\n\ncpp\n\nnode_path.node()->set_attrib(attributeObject);\n\nBut in many cases, especially with the most commonly-modified attributes, you don't need to create the attributes directly as there is a convenience function on NodePath (e.g. .NodePath.set_fog()) that manages the creation of the attributes for you; there will also be a corresponding clear function on NodePath to remove the attribute (.NodePath.clear_fog()).\n\nRender Attribute Priorities\n\nEvery attribute has a priority. By default, that priority is zero. That priority value affects the inheritance of attributes.\n\nlist-of-all-attributes lighting materials depth-test-and-depth-write fog alpha-testing color-write-masks antialiasing clip-planes tinting-and-recoloring backface-culling-and-frontface-culling occlusion-culling/index light-ramps auxiliary-bitplane-control stencil-attribute",
