  "content": "The document discusses Panda's multithreaded render pipeline, explaining how separating Cull and Draw phases into different threads can improve performance by parallelizing processing. It highlights that enabling this feature via Config.prc settings allows frames to be processed faster, up to three times as fast in ideal scenarios where all three phases (App, Cull, Draw) take roughly the same time to execute.\n\nSo, we see that we can now crank out frames up to three times faster than in the original, single-threaded case. Each frame now takes the same amount of time, total, as the longest of the original three phases. (Thus, the theoretical maximum speedup of 3x can only be achieved in practice if all three phases are exactly equal in length.)",
