It focuses on initializing the module finder configuration and managing excluded modules to avoid duplication during the freezing process.\n\nThis context emphasizes the setup of module finding parameters (optimization level, excludes) and the exclusion mechanism that integrates another FreezeTool's processed modules into the current instance, ensuring efficient and non-redundant module handling.\n\nif optimize is None or optimize < 0:\n            self.optimize = sys.flags.optimize\n        else:\n            self.optimize = optimize\n\n        self.mf = PandaModuleFinder(excludes=['doctest'], suffixes=suffixes,\n                                    path=path, optimize=self.optimize)\n\n    def excludeFrom(self, freezer):\n        \"\"\" Excludes all modules that have already been processed by\n        the indicated FreezeTool.
