  "content": "This chunk provides important setup notes for a distributed rendering or simulation system. It specifies required command-line arguments for server configuration (clusterServerPort, clusterSyncFlag, etc.) and highlights potential limitations with multi-camera setups in the cluster environment. This context helps developers understand initial server requirements and known issues when working on distributed projects involving camera management across clients.\n\n# NOTE: This assumes the following variables are set via bootstrap command line\n# arguments on server startup:\n#     clusterServerPort\n#     clusterSyncFlag\n#     clusterDaemonClient\n#     clusterDaemonPort\n# Also, I'm not sure multiple camera-group configurations are working for the\n# cluster system.",
