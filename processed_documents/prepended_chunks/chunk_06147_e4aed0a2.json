  "content": "The given chunk discusses how to handle standard library headers that may cause complications for Interrogate. It explains the solution of placing mock header files in a parser-include directory to simplify declarations and avoid unnecessary complexity.\n\nThis is especially true for many standard library headers, which provide many interfaces that Interrogate will not need, and often contain a lot of compiler magic that Interrogate has trouble understanding.\n\nIn these situations, the easiest approach is to place a header in a parser-inc directory, which is passed to Interrogate using the -s option. This causes Interrogate to read these mock header files instead of the actual versions, and pick up the declarations therein.\n\nThis header file may be empty if the code does not need to use any of the interfaces defined therein, or may contain some simple forward declarations and typedefs so that Interrogate knows of the existence of these external interfaces, even though it doesn't need to do anything with them.",
