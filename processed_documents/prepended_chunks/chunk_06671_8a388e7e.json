  "content": "The chunk introduces Panda3D's 2D scene graphs, specifically discussing the `render` node for 3D objects and the `render2d` node for GUI elements like text or buttons.\n\nGUI\n\nThe 2D Scene Graphs\n\nBy default, there are two different scene graphs created automatically when you start up Panda3D. These graphs are referred to by their top nodes: render and render2d.\n\nYou use render most often; this is the top of the ordinary 3-D scene. In order to put an object in the world, you will need to parent it to render (or to some node that is in turn parented to render).\n\nYou will use render2d to render 2-D GUI elements, such as text or buttons, that you want to display onscreen; for instance, a heads-up display. Anything parented to render2d will be rendered on top of the 3-D scene, as if it were painted on the screen glass.",
