  "content": "The chunk explains the various ways to initialize a projectile trajectory in the `ProjectileInterval` class by specifying different combinations of input parameters such as start position, end position, duration, starting velocity, waypoint, time to waypoint, and target Z plane. It also describes how gravity can be adjusted using a multiplier.\n\n# go from startPos to endPos in duration seconds\n        startPos, endPos, duration\n        # given a starting velocity, go for a specific time period\n        startPos, startVel, duration\n        # given a starting velocity, go until you hit a given Z plane\n        startPos, startVel, endZ\n        # pass through wayPoint at time 'timeToWayPoint'. Go until\n        # you hit a given Z plane\n        startPos, wayPoint, timeToWayPoint, endZ\n\n        You may alter gravity by providing a multiplier in 'gravityMult'.\n        '2.' will make gravity twice as strong, '.5' half as strong.\n        '-1.' will reverse gravity",
