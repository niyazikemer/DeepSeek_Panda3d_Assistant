It processes events associated with a completed interest, removes the interest if necessary, sends completion events, logs debug information, and checks if all interests are complete to trigger a global completion event. This code is crucial for managing client-side interest subscriptions and ensuring proper cleanup and notification when interests are finalized.\n\nstate.zoneIdList)\n            self._considerRemoveInterest(handle)\n            for event in eventsToSend:\n                messenger.send(event)\n        else:\n            DoInterestManager.notify.warning(\n                \"handleInterestDoneMessage: handle not found: %s\" % (handle))\n        # if there are no more outstanding interest-completes, send out global all-done event\n        if self._completeEventCount.num == 0:\n            self.queueAllInterestsCompleteEvent()\n        assert self.printInterestsIfDebug()",
