  "content": "To create a capsule shape in Bullet Physics using Panda3D:\n\n1. **Import the necessary classes**:\n   - In Python: Import `BulletCapsuleShape` from `panda3d.bullet`.\n   - In C++: Include the header `\"bulletCapsuleShape.h\"`.\n\n2. **Define the parameters**:\n   - **Radius**: Determines the radius of the cylindrical part.\n   - **Height**: Specifies the height of the cylindrical section (excluding hemispheres).\n   - **Up-axis**: Optional parameter (e.g., `ZUp`) to define orientation.\n\n3. **Create the capsule shape**:\n   ```python\n   from panda3d.bullet import BulletCapsuleShape\n   radius = 0.5\n   height = 1.0\n   capsule_shape = BulletCapsuleShape(radius, height, ZUp)\n   ```\n   \n4. **C++ Example**:\n   ```cpp\n   #include \"bulletCapsuleShape.h\"\n   double radius = 0.5;\n   double height = 1.0;\n   PT(BulletCapsuleShape) capsule_shape = new BulletCapsuleShape(radius, height);\n   ```\n\nThis setup defines a capsule with rounded ends for applications requiring smooth collision handling, such as character movement.\n\ncpp\n\n#include \"bulletCylinderShape.h\"\n...\ndouble radius = 0.5;\ndouble height = 1.4;\nPT(BulletCylinderShape) cylinder_shape_one = new BulletCylinderShape(radius, height);\n\nCapsule Shape\n\nA primitive collision shape which is a \"capped\" cylinder. \"Capped\" means that there are half-spheres at both ends, unlike the real cylinder which has flat ends. Capsule shapes are a good choice for character controllers, since they are fast, symmetrical, and allow smooth movement over steps.\n\nTo create a capsule shape we have to pass the capsule's radius, the height of the cylindrical part, and the up-axis. The total height of the capsule will be the height of the cylindrical part, plus twice the radius.\n\npython\n\nfrom panda3d.bullet import BulletCapsuleShape\nradius = 0.5\nheight = 1.0\nshape = BulletCapsuleShape(radius, height, ZUp)\n\ncpp\n\n#include \"bulletCapsuleShape.h\"\n...\ndouble radius = 0.5;\ndouble height = 1.0;\nPT(BulletCapsuleShape) capsule_shape = new BulletCapsuleShape(radius, height);",
