  "content": "The chunk describes a Python decorator-generating function named `report`, which is part of a larger collection of utility functions and classes for debugging, profiling, and error handling. The function allows developers to add specific logging or profiling information (e.g., timestamps, frame counts) when decorating another function, with behavior conditional on a development environment flag.\n\ndef report(types = [], prefix = '', xform = None, notifyFunc = None, dConfigParam = []):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is a decorator generating function.  Use is similar to\n    a @decorator, except you must be sure to call it as a function.\n    It actually returns the decorator which is then used to transform\n    your decorated function. Confusing at first, I know.\n\n    Decoration occurs at function definition time.\n\n    If __dev__ is not defined, or resolves to False, this function\n    has no effect and no wrapping/transform occurs.  So in production,\n    it's as if the report has been asserted out.\n\n    Parameters:\n        types: A subset list of ['timeStamp', 'frameCount', 'avLocation']\n            This allows you to specify certain useful bits of info:",
