  "content": "This chunk is part of a section in the document that explains how to use the Actor class in Panda3D for loading and manipulating animatable models. The context focuses on the high-level interface provided by the Actor class for managing animations, distinguishing it from the unrelated ActorNode physics class, and demonstrates how to import and construct an Actor instance while loading model and animation files through a dictionary mapping.\n\nThe Actor interface provides a high-level interface on the low-level Panda constructs. In Panda, the low-level node that performs the animation is called .Character. You can see the Character node in the scene graph when you call actor.ls() <direct.actor.Actor.Actor.ls>.\n\nDo not confuse the Actor class with the ActorNode <enabling-physics-on-a-node> class, which is used for physics. They are completely unrelated classes with similar names.\n\nUsing Actors\n\nThe Actor class must be imported before any loading or manipulation of actors.\n\nfrom direct.actor.Actor import Actor\n\nOnce this is done, the actor object can be constructed, and the model and animations can be loaded.\n\nLoading each animation requires a dictionary, where each key is a meaningful name given to the animation and the corresponding value is the path to the animation file.\n\nAll of the above can be written as a single statement:\n\nactor = Actor('hero.egg', {\n    'walk': 'hero-walk.egg',\n    'swim': 'hero-swim.egg',\n})",
