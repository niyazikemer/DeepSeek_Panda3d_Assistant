  "content": "This section explains the functionality of .TextureStage in Panda3D, detailing how each stage holds one texture per node but allows different textures across nodes. It highlights that while a TextureStage can only hold one texture per node, you can use multiple stages to layer multiple textures on a single model, enabling multitexturing effects like combining bump maps and color overlays.\n\nEach .TextureStage can hold one texture image for a particular model. If you assign a texture to a particular TextureStage, and then later (or at a lower node) assign a different texture to the same TextureStage, the new texture completely replaces the old one. (Within the overall scene, a given TextureStage can be used to hold any number of different textures for different nodes; but it only holds one texture for any one particular node.)\n\nHowever, you can have as many different TextureStages as you want. If you create a new TextureStage and use it to assign a second texture to a node, then the node now has both textures assigned to it.",
