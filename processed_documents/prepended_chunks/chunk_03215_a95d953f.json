This function manages the selection of objects, checks their editability, records undo points, and updates widget visibility to prepare for object editing operations. It plays a key role in enabling interactive transformations and maintaining the integrity of selected objects during the manipulation process.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef manipulateObject(self):\n        # Only do this if something is selected\n        direct = ShowBaseGlobal.direct\n        selectedList = direct.selected.getSelectedAsList()\n        # See if any of the selected are completely uneditable\n        editTypes = self.getEditTypes(selectedList)\n        if (editTypes & DG.EDIT_TYPE_UNEDITABLE) == DG.EDIT_TYPE_UNEDITABLE:\n            return\n        self.currEditTypes = editTypes\n        if selectedList:\n            # Remove the task to keep the widget attached to the object\n            taskMgr.remove('followSelectedNodePath')\n            # and the task to highlight the widget\n            taskMgr.remove('highlightWidgetTask')\n            # Set manipulation flag\n            self.fManip = 1\n            # Record undo point\n            direct.pushUndo(direct.selected)\n            # Update object handles visibility\n            if hasattr(direct, 'widget'):\n                direct.widget.showGuides()\n                direct.widget.hideAllHandles()",
