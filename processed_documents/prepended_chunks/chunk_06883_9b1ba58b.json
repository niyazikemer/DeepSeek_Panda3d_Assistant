  "content": "The chunk describes key parameters and configurations for controlling the behavior of particle systems in a software application, including system lifespan, velocity settings, position, orientation, and factory-related properties such as particle lifespan variation, mass, terminal velocity, and more. This information is part of a broader guide explaining how to create and customize particle effects.\n\nAge in seconds at which the system (vs. Particles) should die. Default is 0, which means the particle generator won't die.\n\nWhether or not velocities are absolute.\n\nSystem has a lifespan or not. Length set in \"Lifespan\".\n\nParticle system position (0,0,0 by default)\n\nParticle system orientation (0,0,0 by default)\n\nSome of this information can also be found in the Particle Effect Basic Parameters page.\n\nFactory:\n\nType of the particle factory. The differences between these factories lie in the orientation and rotational abilities.\n\nAverage particle lifespan in seconds. Sets how long each particle should exist.\n\nVariation in lifespan. Default is 0, which means all particles will have the same lifespan.\n\nAverage particle mass.\n\nVariation in particle mass.\n\nAverage particle terminal velocity.\n\nVariation in terminal velocity.\n\nSome of this information can also be found in the Particle Factories page.\n\nEmitter:",
