  "content": "This code chunk is situated within the `TaskManager` class, specifically within a method responsible for managing task execution and profiling. The chunk handles the profiling of a specified number of frames, exception handling for interruptions or errors during task execution, and resource management through session release. It also includes optional callback execution after profiling completes. This section ensures proper cleanup and error handling while executing profiled tasks.\n\ndef _profileFunc(numFrames: int = numFrames) -> None:\n                            self._doProfiledFrames(numFrames)\n                        session.setFunc(_profileFunc)\n                        session.run()\n                        del _profileFunc\n                        if callback:\n                            callback()\n                        session.release()\n                    else:\n                        self.step()\n                except KeyboardInterrupt:\n                    self.stop()\n                except SystemExit:\n                    self.stop()\n                    raise\n                except IOError as ioError:\n                    code, message = self._unpackIOError(ioError)\n                    # Since upgrading to Python 2.4.1, pausing the execution\n                    # often gives this IOError during the sleep function:\n                    #     IOError: [Errno 4] Interrupted function call",
