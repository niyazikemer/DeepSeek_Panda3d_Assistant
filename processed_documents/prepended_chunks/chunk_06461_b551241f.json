  "content": "This chunk situates within a section discussing NodePath-based LerpIntervals, explaining their similar parameter structures, shortcut methods, and introducing combination LerpIntervals as efficient alternatives to Parallel setups for simultaneous animations.\n\nEach of the above has a similar set of parameters as those of LerpPosInterval. They also have a similar shortcut (e.g. model.hprInterval(), etc.) Finally, there is a handful of combination LerpIntervals that perform multiple lerps at the same time. (You can also achieve the same effect by combining several LerpIntervals within a Parallel <sequences-and-parallels>, but these combination intervals are often simpler to use, and they execute just a bit faster.)",
