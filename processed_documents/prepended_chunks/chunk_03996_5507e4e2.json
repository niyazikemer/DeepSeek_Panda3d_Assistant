  "content": "The provided chunk is a group of snake_case method aliases in a Python class that handle settings related to color encoding (sRGB), exposure adjustments, and high dynamic range rendering. These methods correspond to their camelCase counterparts defined earlier in the document, providing alternative naming conventions for developers who prefer underscores over camelCase. The chunk is situated within the section where all snake_case aliases are grouped together at the end of the document.\n\nContext: The chunk defines snake_case aliases for methods that manage sRGB encoding, exposure adjustments, and HDR rendering settings in a graphics or visualization library. These aliases provide alternative access to features related to color correction, brightness control, and high dynamic range output, enabling developers to customize how images are rendered and displayed.\n\ndel_srgb_encode = delSrgbEncode\n    set_exposure_adjust = setExposureAdjust\n    del_exposure_adjust = delExposureAdjust\n    set_high_dynamic_range = setHighDynamicRange\n    del_high_dynamic_range = delHighDynamicRange",
