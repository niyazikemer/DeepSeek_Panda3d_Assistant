  "content": "The provided chunk is part of the C++ section within the document's guide on creating a new Panda3D application, specifically detailing window setup, main loop execution, and program closure. It explains how to configure the window title, enter the main rendering loop, and provides context for further development steps in C++.\n\n// Set the window title and open the window\n  framework.set_window_title(\"My Panda3D Window\");\n  WindowFramework *window = framework.open_window();\n\n  // Here is room for your own code\n\n  // Do the main loop, equal to run() in python\n  framework.main_loop();\n  framework.close_framework();\n  return (0);\n}\n\nFor information about the Window Framework to open a window, click here <the-window-framework>.\n\npandaFramework.h and pandaSystem.h load most of the Panda3D modules. The main_loop() subroutine contains the Panda3D main loop. It renders a frame, handles the background tasks, and then repeats. It does not normally return, so it needs to be called only once and must be the last line in your script. In this particular example, there will be nothing to render, so you should expect a window containing an empty grey area.\n\nRunning the Program\n\nThe steps required to build and run your program were already explained in a previous page <running-your-program>.",
