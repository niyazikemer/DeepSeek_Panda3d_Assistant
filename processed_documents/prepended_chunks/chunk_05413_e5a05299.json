  "content": "The provided chunk is part of a larger system defining message types and their corresponding integer identifiers. The messages are categorized under different sections such as \"State Server control messages,\" \"Client Agent commands,\" and others. These identifiers are used to communicate between different components of a distributed system, likely related to networking or online gaming infrastructure.\n\nThe specific chunk provided defines additional State Server control messages with unique IDs (2000-2042), each corresponding to specific operations like creating objects with required fields, deleting AI objects, and handling object location changes. These messages are part of the overall communication protocol between components in the system, enabling distributed state management and coordination.\n\nThe entire document is structured to map message names to unique IDs for efficient lookup and transmission, with support for debugging through inverse mappings (ID to name). The system also includes special lists like \"QUIET_ZONE_IGNORED_LIST\" for managing messages during specific operational states.\n\n# State Server control messages:\nSTATESERVER_CREATE_OBJECT_WITH_REQUIRED =         2000\nSTATESERVER_CREATE_OBJECT_WITH_REQUIRED_OTHER =   2001\nSTATESERVER_DELETE_AI_OBJECTS =                   2009\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_GET_FIELD =                    2010\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_GET_FIELD_RESP =               2011\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_GET_FIELDS =                   2012\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_GET_FIELDS_RESP =              2013\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_GET_ALL =                      2014\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_GET_ALL_RESP =                 2015\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_SET_FIELD =                    2020\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_SET_FIELDS =                   2021\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_DELETE_FIELD_RAM =             2030\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_DELETE_FIELDS_RAM =            2031\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_DELETE_RAM =                   2032\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_SET_LOCATION =                         2040\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_CHANGING_LOCATION =                    2041\nSTATESERVER_OBJECT_ENTER_LOCATION_WITH_REQUIRED =         2042",
