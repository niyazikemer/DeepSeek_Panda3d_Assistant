  "content": "The provided code sets up an AI evasion simulation in Panda3D using the PandAI library. Here's a clear breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The `World` class initializes by disabling the mouse and setting up the camera for viewing the scene.\n\n2. **Model Loading**:\n   - Two models are loaded: an evader (using the Ralph model) positioned at (-10, 0, 0) and a target (an arrow) starting at (5, 0, 0). Both are scaled appropriately and added to the rendering scene.\n\n3. **AI Setup**:\n   - An `AIWorld` is created, which manages AI characters.\n   - An `AICharacter` named \"evader\" is defined with specified parameters: mass (100), max force (5), and max speed (5). These control movement characteristics like acceleration and speed limits.\n\n4. **Behavior Application**:\n   - The evader's behavior is set to evade the target using `self.AIbehaviors.evade(self.target)`. This causes the AI to continuously adjust its movement direction away from the target.\n\n5. **Target Movement**:\n   - The target moves in response to arrow key inputs, updating its position each frame by a small amount determined by a speed variable.\n\n6. **Continuous Updates**:\n   - Both the evader's behavior and the target's position are updated continuously within their respective task loops, ensuring smooth and responsive movement.\n\nThis setup allows the AI character to dynamically evade the moving target, providing a basic example of steering behaviors in action using Panda3D and PandAI.\n\ndef __init__(self):\n        base.disableMouse()\n        base.cam.setPosHpr(0, 0, 55, 0, -90, 0)\n\n        self.loadModels()\n        self.setAI()\n        self.setMovement()\n\n    def loadModels(self):\n        # Seeker\n        ralphStartPos = Vec3(-10, 0, 0)\n        self.evader = Actor(\"models/ralph\",\n                            {\"run\":\"models/ralph-run\"})\n        self.evader.reparentTo(render)\n        self.evader.setScale(0.5)\n        self.evader.setPos(ralphStartPos)\n        # Target\n        self.target = loader.loadModel(\"models/arrow\")\n        self.target.setColor(1,0,0)\n        self.target.setPos(5,0,0)\n        self.target.setScale(1)\n        self.target.reparentTo(render)\n\n    def setAI(self):\n        #Creating AI World\n        self.AIworld = AIWorld(render)\n\n        self.AIchar = AICharacter(\"evader\",self.evader, 100, 0.05, 5)\n        self.AIworld.addAiChar(self.AIchar)\n        self.AIbehaviors = self.AIchar.getAiBehaviors()",
