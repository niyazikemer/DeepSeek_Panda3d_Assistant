  "content": "The provided chunk is part of a custom import mechanism in a Python script designed to work with Panda's virtual file system (VFS). The main document implements a VFSImporter class that extends Python's import system, allowing modules to be loaded from various sources (e.g., zip files or other archives) managed by the VFS. It also includes support for shared packages, which are collections of modules spread across multiple directories.\n\nThe specific chunk is intended to be placed within the `VFSImporter._load_module()` method. This method is responsible for loading a module after locating its file within the virtual file system. The chunk checks whether the current module being loaded is a child of a previously identified shared package. If so, it ensures the module is loaded correctly by leveraging the VFSSharedImporter, which handles merging modules from multiple directories. If not part of a shared package, it proceeds to read and execute the module's code as usual.\n\nIn essence, this chunk enhances the import system to properly handle hierarchical shared packages, ensuring that child modules are loaded from all relevant directories within the VFS structure.\n\n# Check if this is a child of a shared package.\n        if not loadingShared and self.packagePath and '.' in fullname:\n            parentname = fullname.rsplit('.', 1)[0]\n            if parentname in sharedPackages:\n                # It is.  That means it's a shared package too.\n                parent = sys.modules[parentname]\n                path = getattr(parent, '__path__', None)\n                importer = VFSSharedImporter()\n                sharedPackages[fullname] = True\n                loader = importer.find_module(fullname, path = path)\n                assert loader\n                return loader.load_module(fullname)\n\n        code = self._read_code()\n        if not code:\n            raise ImportError('No Python code in %s' % (fullname))",
