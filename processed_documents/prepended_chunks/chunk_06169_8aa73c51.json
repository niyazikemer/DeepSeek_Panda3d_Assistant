It covers setting up materials, linear stiffness, bending constraints, margin settings for collision detection, and visualization of the soft body patch using a `GeomNode` for rendering.\n\"\"\"\n\nNow we can create the soft body node using the factory method makePatch. The following configuration differs from what we have seen for soft body ropes.\n\nFirst we create an additional material attached to the soft body. Initially a soft body has already one material, but for this example we want a second one.\n\nOn the material we set the linear stiffness, and the create bending constraints for this material.\n\nFinally we choose a value of about the grid spacing for the soft bodies margin. Other bodies colliding with the soft body could fall through in between the nodes if the value is too small, and if it is too large they will already collide with the soft body when still noticeably far away.\n\nVisualisation\n\nIn order to have a visual representation of the soft body patch we need a GeomNode. Panda3D's Bullet module has a helper method which will do the work for us. The following code snippet shows how use this helper method.\n\npython",
