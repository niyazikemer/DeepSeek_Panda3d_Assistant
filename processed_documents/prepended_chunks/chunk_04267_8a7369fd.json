  "content": "This code chunk is part of a larger Python script designed for garbage detection and reporting. Specifically, the code sits within a method that generates detailed reports about garbage objects in memory. The chunk is responsible for appending structured information to a report string, including details about what objects are referring to garbage items (referrers) and what garbage items are referring to other objects (referents). This information is crucial for diagnosing memory leaks and understanding object relationships within the application.\n\nThe code iterates through garbage items, formatting their indices and related data into sections of the report. Each section is clearly labeled to help developers identify potential issues by examining how garbage objects are interconnected.\n\nif self._args.fullReport:\n                format = '%0' + '%s' % digits + 'i:%s'\n                s.append('===== Referrers By Number (what is referring to garbage item?) =====')\n                for i in range(numGarbage):\n                    yield None\n                    s.append(format % (i, self.referrersByNumber[i]))\n                s.append('===== Referents By Number (what is garbage item referring to?) =====')\n                for i in range(numGarbage):\n                    yield None\n                    s.append(format % (i, self.referentsByNumber[i]))\n                s.append('===== Referrers (what is referring to garbage item?) =====')\n                for i in range(numGarbage):\n                    yield None\n                    s.append(format % (i, self.referrersByReference[i]))\n                s.append('===== Referents (what is garbage item referring to?) =====')\n                for i in range(numGarbage):\n                    yield None",
