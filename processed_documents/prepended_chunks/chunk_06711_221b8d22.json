This is used to control\nPfmVizzer::make_displacement(). allow-async-bind bool 1 allow-collider-multiple bool 0 Set this true to enable the use of a DoubleBitMask or QuadBitMask to\nmanage many colliders added to a single traverser in one pass. If this\nis false, a one-word BitMask is always used instead, which is faster per\npass, but may require more passes. allow-flatten-color bool 0 allows color to always be flattened to vertices allow-incomplete-render bool 1 When this is true, the frame may be rendered even if some of the\ngeometry in the scene has been paged out, or if the textures are\nunavailable. The nonresident geometry and textures will be rendered as\nsoon as they can be read from disk, which may be several frames in the\nfuture. When this is false, geometry is always paged in immediately when",
