  "content": "The document contains various configuration settings related to graphics rendering, application behavior, window management, input handling, and performance optimization. The chunk in question discusses advanced control over vertex joint assignments in 3D modeling, the quantization of vertex joint membership values when loading EGG files, and a boolean flag to enforce attribute locking for shader generation.\n\ncontrol any one vertex. If a vertex requests assignment to more than\nthis number of joints, the joints with the lesser membership value are\nignored. Set this to -1 to allow any number of joints. egg-vertex-membership-quantize double 0.1 Specifies the nearest amount to round each vertex joint membership\nvalue when loading an egg file. This affects animated egg files only.\nThere is a substantial runtime performance advantage for reducing\ntrivial differences in joint membership. Set this to 0 to leave joint\nmembership as it is. enforce-attrib-lock bool 1 When a MaterialAttrib, TextureAttrib, or LightAttrib is constructed,\nthe corresponding Material, Texture, or Light is 'attrib locked.' The\nattrib lock prevents qualitative changes to the object. This makes it\npossible to hardwire information about material, light, and texture\nproperties into generated shaders. This config variable can disable the\nattrib lock. Disabling the lock will break the shader generator, but",
