  "content": "This chunk introduces the Panda3D Distribution's sample programs, explaining their purpose and features while providing instructions on accessing and running them. It includes several examples of these samples, such as asteroids, ball- in-maze, and boxing-robots, each demonstrating specific engine functionalities.\n\nSample Programs in the Distribution\n\nThe Panda3D Distribution includes quite a few sample programs. The following is a list of what's included, and which features of the engine each sample demonstrates. If you are just learning Panda3D, take a look at the ones marked as \"Beginner\" difficulty.\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install the Panda3D SDK. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d. On macOS, you'll find them in /Developer/Examples/Panda3D/ (or /Library/Developer/Examples/Panda3D as of Panda3D 1.10.5). Alternatively, you can download the samples separately from the download page.\n\nasteroids\n\nDifficulty: Advanced\n\nCreating tasks (routines that get called every frame)\n\nUsing 2D graphics\n\nball-in-maze\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nUsing the collision detector\n\nReading the mouse\n\nboxing-robots\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nLoading animated actors and playing animations",
