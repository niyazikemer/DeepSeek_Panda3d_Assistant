It also provides alternative solutions, such as creating an 'input' group, to manage access securely without compromising system security.\n\"\"\"\n\nTo use raw mouse input under Linux, the panda program needs to open the device files /dev/input/event*. On many Linux distributions, the permission bits are set such that this is not possible.\n\nIt is not a good idea to just change the permission bits. Doing so introduces a huge security hole in which any logged in user can monitor the mice, the joysticks, and the keyboard --- including any passwords that may be typed. The correct solution is to change the ownership of the input devices whenever a user sits down at the console. There is a module, pam_console, that does this, but it is now obsoleted, and has been removed from several distros. The Fedora pam_console removal page states that ACLs set by the HAL should replace pam_console's functionality. Currently, since it does not seem that HAL provides this yet, the best course of action is to make an 'input' group as described on this page.",
