  "content": "This chunk is situated within a document describing the implementation of avatar controls in a 3D environment, focusing on handling collisions and events such as jumping, movement, and interaction with the environment. The specific code pertains to adding colliders for event detection and trigger handling, determining whether events should be triggered immediately upon intersection or after position adjustments by the pusher system. It is part of a larger method that configures collision detection settings and event triggers based on certain conditions and preferences.\n\nif self.earlyEventSphere:\n                    # If we want to trigger the events at the same\n                    # time as we intersect walls (e.g. Toontown, for\n                    # backward compatibility issues), add the event\n                    # sphere to the main traverser.  This allows us to\n                    # hit door triggers that are just slightly behind\n                    # the door itself.\n                    self.cTrav.addCollider(self.cEventSphereNodePath, self.event)\n                else:\n                    # Normally, we'd rather trigger the events after\n                    # the pusher has had a chance to fix up our\n                    # position, so we never trigger things that are\n                    # behind other polygons.\n                    base.shadowTrav.addCollider(self.cEventSphereNodePath, self.event)",
