This function enables developers to track down issues by examining the state of variables at the time of an exception occurrence. It integrates with global configuration settings and overrides default exception initialization behavior when enabled, providing enhanced debugging capabilities for complex applications.\n\ndef install(log, upload):\n    \"\"\"Installs the exception hook.\"\"\"\n    global oldExcepthook\n    global wantStackDumpLog\n    global wantStackDumpUpload\n    global dumpOnExceptionInit\n\n    wantStackDumpLog = log\n    wantStackDumpUpload = upload\n\n    dumpOnExceptionInit = ConfigVariableBool('variable-dump-on-exception-init', False)\n    if dumpOnExceptionInit:\n        # this mode doesn't completely work because exception objects\n        # thrown by the interpreter don't get created until the\n        # stack has been unwound and an except block has been reached\n        if not hasattr(Exception, '_moved__init__'):\n            Exception._moved__init__ = Exception.__init__\n            Exception.__init__ = _varDump__init__\n    else:\n        if sys.excepthook is not _excepthookDumpVars:\n            oldExcepthook = sys.excepthook\n            sys.excepthook = _excepthookDumpVars",
