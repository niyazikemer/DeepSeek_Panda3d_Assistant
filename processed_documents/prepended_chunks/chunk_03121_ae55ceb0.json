It controls whether the Actor smoothly\n        interpolates between consecutive frames of its animation (when\n        the flag is True) or holds each frame until the next one is\n        ready (when the flag is False).  The default value of\n        frameBlend is controlled by the interpolate-frames Config.prc\n        variable.",
