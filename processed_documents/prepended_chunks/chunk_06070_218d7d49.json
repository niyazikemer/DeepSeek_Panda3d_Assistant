  "content": "This chunk discusses additional debugging methods and transitions into explaining analog controls (axes) in Panda3D.\n\nAlternatively you can also add this line somewhere in your application\n\nmessenger.toggleVerbose()\n\nAxes\n\nThe above mechanism works well for digital buttons, which can only be in an on or off state. Many game controllers also have analog controls, often referred to as \"axes\", which can have a variable value. In Panda3D, these values will be 0.0 when the respective control is in its default or resting position, and 1.0 when it is in its maximum position. Some controls can move in two directions, and can have a value of down to -1.0.\n\nThis sample will show how to get the left analog stick of the first gamepad device\n\ngamepad = base.devices.getDevices(InputDevice.DeviceClass.gamepad)[0]\nleft_x = gamepad.findAxis(InputDevice.Axis.left_x)\n\n# Access and use the value for whatever you need it\nleft_x.value",
