  "content": "The chunk introduces the integration of Panda3D's reference counting system with Python and its relevance for low-level C++ code manipulation. It sets the stage for understanding how classes manage reference counts, crucial for advanced users working on detailed implementations.\n\npython\n\nSince this system is entirely integrated with Python's own reference counting system, you generally do not need to be concerned with the details of this system. This page only exists for advanced users who need to manipulate the reference count for low-level integration with C++ code.\n\nThe class that manages the reference count is .ReferenceCount. To see if a class is reference counted, check if it inherits from ReferenceCount. C++ classes that are reference counted inherit from either .ReferenceCount or .TypedReferenceCount (if use of the typing system is desired), or another class that itself inherits from .ReferenceCount.\n\nManaging Reference Counts\n\nThere are several ways that the reference count can be manipulated in code. To get the number of references to an object, use the ~.ReferenceCount.get_ref_count() method.",
