  "content": "The `zoomCam` method is one of several camera manipulation functions (including pan and rotate) within a class responsible for controlling the view of a 3D scene. It handles zooming towards or away from a central point (`coaMarker`) by adjusting the camera's position based on a zoom factor. The method records undo states, uses an animation interval to smoothly transition positions, and updates marker sizing post-animation.\n\ndef zoomCam(self, zoomFactor, t):\n        self.__stopManipulateCamera()\n        # Record undo point\n        direct = ShowBaseGlobal.direct\n        direct.pushUndo([direct.camera])\n        # Find a point zoom factor times the current separation\n        # of the widget and cam\n        zoomPtToCam = self.coaMarker.getPos(direct.camera) * zoomFactor\n        # Put a target nodePath there\n        self.camManipRef.setPos(direct.camera, zoomPtToCam)\n        # Move to that point\n        ival = direct.camera.posInterval(CAM_MOVE_DURATION,\n                                         DG.ZERO_POINT,\n                                         other=self.camManipRef,\n                                         blendType='easeInOut')\n        ival = Sequence(ival, Func(self.updateCoaMarkerSizeOnDeath),\n                        name = 'manipulateCamera')\n        self.__startManipulateCamera(ival = ival)",
