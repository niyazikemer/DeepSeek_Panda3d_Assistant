  "content": "The chunk appears in a section explaining the architecture and functionality of the PStats client code. It follows an introduction to PStats as a real-time profiling tool for analyzing application performance, particularly focusing on how data is collected on the client side before being transmitted to a server for analysis. The context emphasizes the efficiency and minimal runtime overhead of the client-side implementation, especially when not connected to a server or when compiled out, setting up the foundation for understanding how PStats collects and manages performance data across different scenarios.\n\nThe client code is designed for minimal runtime overhead when it is compiled in but not enabled (that is, when the client is not in contact with a PStats server), as well as when it is enabled (when the client is in contact with a PStats server). It is also designed for zero runtime overhead when it is compiled out.\n\nThere is one global .PStatClient class object, which manages all of the communications on the client side. Each PStatCollector is simply an index into an array stored within the PStatClient object, although the interface is intended to hide this detail from the programmer.\n\nInitially, before the PStatClient has established a connection, calls to start() and stop() simply return immediately.",
