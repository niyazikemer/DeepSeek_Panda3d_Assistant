  "content": "The provided code chunk introduces two methods related to loading 3D models in the context of a Loader class: `loadModelNode` and a deprecated method that uses `loadModel`. These methods are part of a broader set of resource management utilities for loading various types of assets (models, fonts, textures, sounds, etc.) efficiently. The primary purpose of `loadModelNode` is to load a model from the model pool without caching it under the \"hidden\" node and return just the Node rather than a NodePath, which is particularly useful for specialized use cases like font loading where NodePath management is unnecessary or undesired.\n\nreturn self.loadModel(modelPath, loaderOptions = loaderOptions, noCache = False)\n\n    def loadModelNode(self, modelPath):\n        \"\"\"\n        modelPath is a string.\n\n        This is like loadModelOnce in that it loads a model from the\n        modelPool, but it does not then instance it to hidden and it\n        returns a Node instead of a NodePath.  This is particularly\n        useful for special models like fonts that you don't care about\n        where they're parented to, and you don't want a NodePath\n        anyway--it prevents accumulation of instances of the font\n        model under hidden.\n\n        However, if you're loading a font, see loadFont(), below.\n        \"\"\"\n        if __debug__:\n            warnings.warn(\"loader.loadModelNode() is deprecated; use loader.loadModel() instead.\", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)\n\n        model = self.loadModel(modelPath, noCache = False)\n        if model is not None:\n            model = model.node()\n\n        return model",
