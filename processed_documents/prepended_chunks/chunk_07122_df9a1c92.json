  "content": "The document provides an overview of using Bullet physics with Panda3D, including features, classes, and integration notes. The chunk highlights the importance of not mixing ODE and Bullet systems while offering sample resources for practical implementation.\n\nNote\n\nThe Panda3D Bullet module makes great effort to integrate Bullet physics as tightly as reasonably possible with the core Panda3D classes. However, when implementing collision detection and physics, you can not mix Panda3D's internal physics & collision system, ODE, and Bullet. More explicitly: Bullet bodies won't collide with ODE bodies and CollisionNodes.\n\nSamples on how to use the Panda3D Bullet module can be found in the following archive: https://www.panda3d.org/download/noversion/bullet-samples.zip\n\ncpp\n\nNote: All samples are currently available in Python code only.",
