  "content": "This chunk provides an explanation of how manipulating a full-screen quad can create various motion trail effects in Panda3D, building on the setup described earlier for achieving motion trails using framebuffer reuse.\n\nYou can get a lot of different effects by simply moving the quad a little bit. By putting it behind the actor, the actor is fully visible, and surrounded by trails. By putting it in front of the actor, the trails overlap the actor. By rotating the quad slightly, you get a whirlpool. By offsetting it or scaling it, you can cause the trails to move away from the actor. You can colorize it, adjust its transparency, and otherwise tweak it in a number of ways.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
