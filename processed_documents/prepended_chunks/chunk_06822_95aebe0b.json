  "content": "The chunk describes specific Panda3D configuration options related to versioning, rendering effects (parallax mapping), and debugging mechanisms. These settings are part of a comprehensive collection of system variables and functions within the Panda3D documentation that influence runtime behavior, visual effects, and development tools.\n\nPandaSystem::get_package_version_str(), in development mode only, and\nonly if another value has not already been compiled in. This is intended\nfor developer convenience, to masquerade a development build of Panda as\na different runtime version. Use with caution. parallax-mapping-samples int 3 Sets the amount of samples to use in the parallax mapping\nimplementation. A value of 0 means to disable it entirely. parallax-mapping-scale double 0.1 Sets the strength of the effect of parallax mapping, that is, how\nmuch influence the height values have on the texture coordinates. paranoid-compose bool 0 Set this true to double-check the componentwise transform compose\n(or invert) operation against the equivalent matrix-based operation.\nThis has no effect if NDEBUG is defined. paranoid-const bool 0 Set this true to double-check that nothing is inappropriately\nmodifying the supposedly const structures like RenderState,\nRenderAttrib, TransformState, and RenderEffect. This has no effect if",
