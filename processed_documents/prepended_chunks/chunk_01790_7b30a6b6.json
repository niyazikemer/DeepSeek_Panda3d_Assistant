  "content": "The provided code snippet defines a class `DirectJoybox` which is a subclass of `DirectObject`. This class is designed for handling input from a joybox device, providing methods for starting and stopping the input handler, normalizing analog inputs, and controlling node movement in 3D space. The included methods enable functionality such as orbiting around a reference coordinate system and adjusting multipliers for position and rotation sensitivity.\n\nThe context of this code is that it's part of a larger application or library designed to handle user interaction via a joybox device in a 3D environment, likely using the Panda3D framework. The `DirectJoybox` class serves as an input handler, enabling users to manipulate objects within a virtual space through various modes such as orbital movement and direct node positioning.\n\nclass DirectJoybox(DirectObject):\n    joyboxCount = 0\n    xyzMultiplier = 1.0\n    hprMultiplier = 1.0",
