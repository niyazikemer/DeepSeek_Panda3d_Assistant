  "content": "The provided code chunk initializes the core components of a collision detection system in a Panda3D application. It defines essential variables such as `base.cTrav` (a `CollisionTraverser` for handling collision checks), `self.collHandler` (a `CollisionHandlerQueue` to manage collision events), and three bitmask constants (`goodMask`, `badMask`, `floorMask`) used to categorize different types of collidable objects. These elements are foundational for setting up selective collision detection between various game or simulation entities in the application.\n\nclass World(DirectObject):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Create a traverser that Panda3D will automatically use every frame.\n        base.cTrav = CollisionTraverser()\n        # Create a handler for the events.\n        self.collHandler = CollisionHandlerQueue()\n\n        # Define a few bitmasks for use.\n        # Teaching the concepts of bitmasks is out of the scope of this sample.\n        # This just shows a practical application of bitmasks.\n        goodMask = BitMask32(0x1)\n        badMask = BitMask32(0x2)\n        floorMask = BitMask32(0x4)",
