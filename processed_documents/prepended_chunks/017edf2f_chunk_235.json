  "content": "The provided code snippets are part of a larger document containing Python modules related to a graphical user interface (GUI) application. The first snippet is from a module that defines a `GraphEditorDialog` class, which implements a graph editor dialog using wxWidgets. This dialog allows users to edit graph data such as animation curves or 3D transformations by providing zoom controls, tangent toggling options, and a tree control for selecting different properties. The second snippet comes from the same document and defines a list of properties related to translation along X, Y, and Z axes, which are likely used within the `GraphEditorDialog` class to populate the tree control or specify data points being edited in the graph.\n\nThe context for this code is a software application that deals with 3D modeling, animation, or game development, where users need to edit and visualize transformation curves over time. The use of `ObjectGlobals` and `AnimGlobals` suggests integration with larger systems managing object properties and animation data.\n\n\"\"\"\nDefines Graph Editor\n\"\"\"\nimport wx\nimport math\nfrom . import ObjectGlobals as OG\nfrom . import AnimGlobals as AG\nfrom wx.lib.embeddedimage import PyEmbeddedImage\n\nproperty =  [\n    \"translateX\",\n    \"translateY\",\n    \"translateZ\"\n]",
