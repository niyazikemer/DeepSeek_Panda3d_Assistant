  "content": "This section discusses the deprecation of Panda3D's older .p3d file-based system for distributing applications, which was complex, required special builds, and did not support Python 3. It introduces the new tools provided by Panda3D that integrate with setuptools to package Python applications into standalone executables, using commands like build_apps and bdist_apps to streamline distribution across multiple platforms.\n\nThe old system that shipped with Panda3D 1.9 and operated on .p3d files is no longer supported. It was too complex to use and maintain, required special builds of Panda3D, and did not work with Python 3.\n\nThese tools are implemented as plug-ins to setuptools, which is the standard build system for packaging Python applications. You can read more about it in its documentation, but the basic idea is that you create a setup.py or setup.cfg file describing the application with a list of files that need to be compiled into the distribution. Then, setup.py is run with a command that tells it what plug-in to invoke to do the appropriate packaging operation.\n\nPanda3D adds two new commands to setuptools:\n\nbuild_apps <building-binaries>: compile the application into one or more stand-alone executable files\n\nbdist_apps <packaging-binaries>: runs build_apps, then packages the compiled executables into various archives and installers for distribution",
