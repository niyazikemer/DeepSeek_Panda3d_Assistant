  "content": "This is an introductory explanation of multitexturing in Panda3D, describing how multiple texture images can be layered on a model. It introduces the concept of .TextureStage as a slot for holding individual textures, explains how textures are applied to models using TextureStages, and clarifies that if no specific TextureStage is specified, the default one is used by default. The explanation sets the foundation for understanding how multiple textures can be combined on a single model in subsequent sections.\n\nMultitexture Introduction\n\nPanda3D provides the ability to apply more than one texture image at a time to the polygons of a model. The textures are applied on top of each other, like coats of paint; very much like the \"layers\" in a popular photo-paint program.\n\nTo layer a second texture on a model, you will have to understand Panda's concept of a .TextureStage. Think of a TextureStage as a slot to hold a single texture image. You can have as many different TextureStages as you want in your scene, and each TextureStage might be used on one, several, or all models.\n\nWhen you apply a texture to a model, for instance with the ~.NodePath.set_texture() call, you are actually binding the texture to a particular TextureStage. If you do not specify a TextureStage to use, Panda assumes you mean the \"default\" TextureStage object, which is a global pointer which you can access as .TextureStage.get_default().",
