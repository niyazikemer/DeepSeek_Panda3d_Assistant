  "content": "The `PruneObjectRefs` class is a helper job within the `ContainerLeakDetector` system designed to clean up invalid container references. Its purpose is to periodically destroy any container references that are no longer valid, thereby preventing resource leaks and maintaining optimal performance. This job runs with normal priority as part of the scheduled maintenance tasks initiated by the detector's main loop.\n\n**Context:**\nPruneObjectRefs is a critical component of the ContainerLeakDetector system, responsible for eliminating invalid container references to prevent memory or resource leaks. It ensures efficient cleanup during periodic checks, fitting seamlessly into the system's maintenance schedule.\n\n</context>\n\nclass PruneObjectRefs(Job):\n    \"\"\"\n    Job to destroy any container refs that are no longer valid.\n    Checks validity by asking for each container\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, name, leakDetector):\n        Job.__init__(self, name)\n        self._leakDetector = leakDetector\n        self.notify = self._leakDetector.notify\n        ContainerLeakDetector.addPrivateObj(self.__dict__)\n\n    def destroy(self):\n        ContainerLeakDetector.removePrivateObj(self.__dict__)\n        Job.destroy(self)\n\n    def getPriority(self):\n        return Job.Priorities.Normal",
