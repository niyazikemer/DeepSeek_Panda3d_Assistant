  "content": "This chunk is part of a method within the `Base` class that handles the creation of new windows in the Panda3D framework. The parameters described determine how the window will be rendered (onscreen, offscreen, or not rendered), whether existing or new cameras will be used for rendering, how unexposed drawing areas are handled, and whether a custom graphics window implementation is integrated into the rendering process. These options provide flexibility in managing multiple windows and their associated rendering contexts within a Panda3D application.\n\n:param type: Either 'onscreen', 'offscreen', or 'none'.\n\n        :param keepCamera: If True, the existing base.cam is set up to\n                           render into the new window.\n\n        :param makeCamera: If True (and keepCamera is False), a new camera is\n                           set up to render into the new window.\n\n        :param unexposedDraw: If not None, it specifies the initial value\n                              of :meth:`~panda3d.core.GraphicsWindow.setUnexposedDraw()`.\n\n        :param callbackWindowDict: If not None, a\n                                   :class:`~panda3d.core.CallbackGraphicsWindow`\n                                   is created instead, which allows the caller\n                                   to create the actual window with its own\n                                   OpenGL context, and direct Panda's rendering\n                                   into that window.",
