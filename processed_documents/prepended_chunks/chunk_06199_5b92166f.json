  "content": "The chunk demonstrates an example where a `smiley` model uses a `TexProjector` to animate its texture coordinates over time. The animation is achieved by linking the smiley's texture transformation to a `lerper` node that moves within the scene, without needing to parent it into the main scene graph. This illustrates how to create dynamic, interval-based texture animations in Panda3D using relative transformations and standalone nodes.\n\nsmiley = loader.loadModel('smiley.egg')\nlerper = NodePath('lerper')\nsmiley.setTexProjector(TextureStage.getDefault(), NodePath(), lerper)\ni = lerper.posInterval(5, VBase3(0, 1, 0))\ni.loop()\n\nNote that you don't even have to parent the animated NodePath into the scene graph. In the above example, we have set up the interval i to repeatedly move the standalone NodePath lerper from position (0, 0, 0) to (0, 1, 0) over 5 seconds. Since smiley is assigned a TexProjector that copies the relative transform from NodePath() to lerper--that is, the net transform of lerper--it means we are really animating the texture coordinates on smiley from (0, 0) to (0, 1) (the Z coordinate is ignored for an ordinary 2-D texture).\n\nProjected Textures",
