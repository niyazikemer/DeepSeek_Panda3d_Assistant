  "content": "This section discusses functions for manipulating sound timing and playback speed, including retrieving or setting the current playback position and adjusting how fast or slow a sound plays.\n\npython\n\nmySound.length()\n\ncpp\n\nmySound->length();\n\nwill return the length of a sound file in seconds.\n\npython\n\nmySound.getTime()\n\ncpp\n\nmySound->get_time();\n\nwill get the current time the 'playback head' of a sound is at in seconds.\n\npython\n\nmySound.setTime(n)\n\ncpp\n\nmySound->set_time(n);\n\nwill set the 'playhead head' of a sound to n (where is seconds).\n\nCaution\n\nWhen using the default OpenAL back-end, setting the time will not take effect immediately. You will need to call ~.AudioSound.play() to restart the sound at the configured position.\n\nChanging Playback Speed\n\nTo change a sound's playback speed, use:\n\npython\n\nmySound.setPlayRate(n)\n\ncpp\n\nmySound->set_play_rate(n);\n\nWhere n is any float.\n\nNegative numbers will play a sound backwards. Passing the value 0 will pause the sound.\n\nYou can also get a sound's play rate with:\n\npython\n\nmySound.getPlayRate()\n\ncpp\n\nmySound->get_play_rate();",
