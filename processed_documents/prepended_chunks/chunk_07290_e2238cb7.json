  "content": "This chunk discusses three common performance issues in Panda3D related to Python calculations, garbage collection, and collision system misuse, situated within a comprehensive list of performance bottlenecks ranked by likelihood, focusing on programming and resource management challenges.\n\npython-calculation. Python is a very slow language. Most Panda3D programs only run a few thousand lines of python per frame, since all the real work is done in C++. Sometimes, though, you need to do some complex calculation, and Panda3D just doesn't contain any C++ code to do it for you. In that case, trying to write the calculation in python can cause problems. You may need a C++ plug-in.\n\nfailure-to-garbage-collect. It's easy to get used to the fact that Python's garbage collector can automatically clean up Panda3D data structures. Unfortunately, there are a few structures that can't be cleaned up automatically. You need to know what they are, or you may end up with a leak.\n\ncollision-system-misuse. The collision system can detect most types of collisions very rapidly. However, it is possible to construct situations that the collision detection system just can't handle. Know what it's good at, and what it's not.",
