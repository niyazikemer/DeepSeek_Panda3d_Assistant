  "content": "The chunk is part of the C++ documentation explaining how task functions control their continuation or termination through return values. It provides an example of a task running for two seconds before completing, illustrating the use of elapsed time and return statuses (DS_Cont or DS_Done). This section helps developers manage task execution flow and resource management effectively.\n\ncpp\n\nThe task function may return either AsyncTask::DS_cont to indicate that the task should be called again next frame, or AsyncTask::DS_done to indicate that it should not be called again.\n\nYou can check how long your task has been running by checking task->get_elapsed_time() in your task function. You can also check how many times the task function has been run by using task->get_elapsed_frames().\n\n#include \"asyncTaskManager.h\"\n\n// This task runs for two seconds, then prints done\nAsyncTask::DoneStatus example_task(GenericAsyncTask *task, void *data) {\n  if (task->get_elapsed_time() < 2.0) {\n    return AsyncTask::DS_cont;\n  }\n  cout << \"Done\" << endl;\n  return AsyncTask::DS_done;\n}\n\nTask Return Values\n\nThe value returned from a task affects how the task manager handles that task going forward.\n\npython",
