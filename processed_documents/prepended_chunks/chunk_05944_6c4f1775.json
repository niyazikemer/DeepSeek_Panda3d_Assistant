  "content": "The chunk provides an introductory overview of texturing in Panda3D, covering basic concepts such as applying textures, exporting models, texture paths (relative or absolute), filename syntax, supported formats like JPG, PNG, TIF, and a brief mention of advanced methods. It serves as the foundational section before delving into more complex topics.\n\nTexturing\n\nAt its simplest, texturing merely consists of applying a texture in your modeling program. When you export the model, the path to the texture and some options for it like filtering or repeat-method (see next pages) are saved into the egg file. The texture paths can be either relative (as seen from the egg file) or absolute (full path). See filename-syntax for more info about Panda's filename syntax. In most cases the relative path makes more sense.\n\nPanda can load JPG, PNG, TIF, and a number of other file formats.\n\nMore advanced texturing methods are described in the following sections.",
