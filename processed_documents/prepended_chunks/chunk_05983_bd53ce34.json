  "content": "The chunk is situated within a document offering tips for artists to streamline collaboration with programmers in an art-to-programmer pipeline. The first point emphasizes pre-checking models in pview to catch issues early, reducing back-and-forth iterations. The second highlights structuring models with optimal hierarchies for easier programming and efficient rendering performance. Together, these points are part of broader advice aimed at minimizing delays and enhancing model quality and efficiency during the development process.\n\n\"Check your model in pview before handing it off.\"\n\nThe biggest delays in the pipeline come from the back and forth iterations between artist and programmer. A quick check with pview will often find missing textures, backward facing polygons, incorrect normals, mis-tagged collision solids, and a host of other problems.\n\n\"Build models with good hierarchy, and don't change the hierarchy unnecessarily.\"\n\nA well organized hierarchy can make a model much easier for a programmer to work with, and can also have a significant effect on rendering performance. For rendering purposes, good hierarchies group objects that are close to each other together, and don't have more than a few hundred to a few thousand triangles (depending on the target hardware) in each node. (Low-end hardware performs better with only a few hundred triangles per node; high-end hardware performs better with several thousand triangles per node.)",
