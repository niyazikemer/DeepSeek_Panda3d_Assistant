  "content": "This section explains the different interface maker options available in Interrogate for generating function wrappers tailored to specific scripting languages. It details the `-c`, `-python`, and `-python-native` options, describing their purposes and benefits, particularly focusing on compatibility with C and Python environments. The example provided illustrates how these options can be applied in practice within a broader guide on using Interrogate effectively.\n\nThe -c option will generate function wrappers using the C calling convention. Any scripting language that can call a C function should be able to make advantage of the interrogate database.\n\nThe -python option will generate function wrappers using the Python calling convention. In this case, the shared library will directly be loadable as python module (after interrogate_module is called), although C++ objects and methods will be converted into an object handle and a list of independent Python functions.\n\nThe -python-native option generates true python objects for C++ objects, and translates all C++ methods to true Python methods. This is the option you will most likely want to use.\n\nYou can also specify a combination of any of those. If all are omitted, the default is -c.\n\nExample\n\nHere's a small example:",
