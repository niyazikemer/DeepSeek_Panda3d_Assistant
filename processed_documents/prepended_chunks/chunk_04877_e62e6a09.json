  "content": "The provided code chunk is a section of the `ShowBase` class from `ToonBase.py`, which includes methods for managing application termination (`getExitErrorCode`), printing environment debug information (`printEnvDebugInfo`), and safely destroying the ShowBase instance and its resources (`destroy`).
