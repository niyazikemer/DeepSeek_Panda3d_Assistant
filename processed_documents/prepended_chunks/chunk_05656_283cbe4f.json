  "content": "This chunk is part of the `DistributedSmoothNodeBase` class implementation in the `DistributedSmoothNodeBase.py` module. Specifically, it contains two methods related to broadcasting position and heading data: `_posHprBroadcast`, which handles periodic updates using a Panda3D Task, and `sendCurrentPosition`, which ensures the current position is sent immediately if no active broadcast task exists. These methods are integral to managing smooth node data synchronization between server and client in distributed applications.\n\ndef _posHprBroadcast(self, task=DummyTask):\n        # TODO: we explicitly stagger the initial task timing in\n        # startPosHprBroadcast; we should at least make an effort to keep\n        # this task accurately aligned with its period and starting time.\n        self.d_broadcastPosHpr()\n        task.setDelay(self.__broadcastPeriod)\n        return Task.again\n\n    def sendCurrentPosition(self):\n        # if we're not currently broadcasting, make sure things are set up\n        if self.d_broadcastPosHpr is None:\n            self.cnode.initialize(self, self.dclass, self.doId)\n        self.cnode.sendEverything()",
