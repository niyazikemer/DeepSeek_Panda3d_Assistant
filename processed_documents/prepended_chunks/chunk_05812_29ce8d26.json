  "content": "The chunk discusses the recommended method for loading glTF files in Panda3D, emphasizing the use of the third-party panda3d-gltf plug-in over the Assimp plug-in due to its maturity and feature set.\n\nglTF Plug-In\n\nAn increasingly commonly used format for 3D assets is the glTF format <gltf-files>. This is a standard format that is very widely supported by many modelling suites. There are also many models available on the internet in this format.\n\nThe best way to load these files is via the third-party panda3d-gltf plug-in. This plug-in is not included with Panda3D by default, but needs to be installed separately. The easiest way is to use the following pip command:\n\npython -m pip install -U panda3d-gltf\n\nIf you do not install panda3d-gltf, Panda3D will load glTF files using the Assimp plug-in, which also supports glTF files. However, panda3d-gltf is significantly more mature and featureful than the Assimp loader, so it is strongly recommended that you use panda3d-gltf instead.\n\nFor more information on the glTF format and importing glTF files into Panda3D, see gltf-files.\n\nAssimp Plug-In",
