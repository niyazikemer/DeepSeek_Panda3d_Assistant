  "content": "This section explains how to define and utilize Function Intervals in Python, which execute functions immediately when called rather than over a period of time like Function Lerp Intervals. It provides examples of using `Func()` to wrap functions for use in sequences or parallels, including passing arguments if needed. The section also notes that this functionality is specific to Python.\n\nFunction Intervals\n\npython\n\nFunction intervals are different from function lerp intervals. While the function lerp interval passes data to a function over a period of time, a function interval will simply execute a function when called. As such, a function interval\u2019s use really appears when combined with sequences and parallels. The function interval\u2019s format is simple.\n\nintervalName = Func(myFunction)\n\nYou pass the function without parentheses (i.e. you pass Func- a function pointer) as the parameter. If myFunction takes arguments, then pass them as parameters to Func as follows:\n\ndef myFunction(arg1, arg2):\n   # Do something.\n\nintervalName = Func(myFunction, arg1, arg2)\n\nFunctions cannot be called on their own in sequences and parallels, so it is necessary to wrap them in an interval in order to call them. Since function intervals have no duration, they complete the moment they are called.\n\ncpp\n\nAs FunctionInterval is implemented in Python, this section does not apply to C++.",
