  "content": "This section discusses how to convert between .egg and .bam files in Panda3D, including tips for loading models and saving geometry as BAM files.\n\nYou can always convert egg files to bam files using the program egg2bam <converting-egg-to-bam>. For many simple models, it is also possible to convert back again with the program bam2egg <list-of-panda3d-executables>, but you should not rely on this, since it does not convert advanced features like animation; and some structure of the original egg file may be lost in the conversion.\n\nYou can load files of these formats, as well as any other supported format <supported-model-formats>, using the loader.loadModel <model-files> interface. Any file types other than .bam or .egg will be automatically converted at runtime, exactly as if you had run the appropriate command-line conversion tool first.\n\nThe Bam Interface\n\nThe easiest way to save geometry is to use to call write_bam_file(filename) <.NodePath.write_bam_file> from the NodePath that contains your geometry.\n\nmyPanda = loader.loadModel(\"panda\")",
