  "content": "To automatically animate textures using egg-texture-cards, you can create a SequenceNode that cycles through polygons at a specified frame rate. Once loaded, use pose() to set the starting frame before rendering. By default, all polygons are the same size, requiring uniform texture dimensions. However, for effects like scaling explosions, the -p parameter adjusts polygon sizes relative to each texture's dimensions.\n\nflip = loader.loadModel('flip.egg')\nflip.find('**/+SequenceNode').node().pose(startFrame)\nflip.reparentTo(render)\n\nBy default, all of the polygons created by egg-texture-cards will have the same size. This means that all of your textures must be the same size as well. While this is a simple configuration, it may not be ideal for certain effects. For instance, to animate an explosion, which starts small and grows larger, it would be better to use a small texture image on a small polygon when the image is small, and have a larger image on a larger polygon when it grows larger. You can achieve this effect, with the -p parameter; specifying -p scales each frame's polygon in relation to the size of the corresponding texture:\n\negg-texture-cards -o flip.egg -fps 30 -p 240,240 explosion*.jpg\n\nThere are several other parameters as well; use egg-texture-cards -h for a complete list.",
