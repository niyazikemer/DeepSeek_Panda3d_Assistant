  "content": "The `newEvent()` method generates a unique event name by combining the EventGroup's name, a serial number, and another specified part of the name. This ensures events are unique without repeating information already present in the group's name. The `_subEventComplete()` method checks if a sub-event has been completed; if not, it adds it to the set of completed events. When all required sub-events are completed (i.e., when `self._completedEvents` equals `self._subEvents`), it triggers `_signalComplete()`, which marks the group as completed, sends out its done event via the messenger system, and destroys itself by calling `self.destroy()`.\n\ndef newEvent(self, name):\n        \"\"\" Pass in an event name and it will be unique-ified for you and added\n        to this EventGroup.
