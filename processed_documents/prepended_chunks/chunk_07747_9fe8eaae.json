  "content": "The chunk is situated within sections discussing methods to convert various modeling software outputs, specifically Autodesk Maya and Blender models, into the Egg format using Panda3D tools. It highlights specific utilities like Maya exporters and YABEE for Blender, providing a guide on file format conversion in Panda3D.\n\nConverting to Egg\n\nIf a file format cannot be loaded directly by a supported loader plug-in, it needs to be converted to a supported format first. This can be done using a conversion utility or with a plug-in for the modelling program. Panda3D provides various such tools and plug-ins for converting models to the Egg format.\n\nAutodesk Maya\n\nPanda3D provides a series of utility programs for converting Maya models (.ma or .mb) to Panda3D. One such utility exists for each supported version of Maya. For example, the utility for Maya 2019 is called egg2maya2019.exe.\n\nFurthermore, a script is provided that can be used to export .egg files directly from the Maya user interface.\n\nFor more information, see converting-from-maya.\n\nBlender\n\nThere are various community-contributed exporters available for exporting models from Blender to Egg. For Blender versions 2.5x through 2.7x, the tool of choice is YABEE:\n\nhttps://github.com/09th/YABEE",
