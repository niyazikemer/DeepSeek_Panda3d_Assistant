  "content": "\"\"\"\nThis document provides an overview of the Glow Filter sample programs in Panda3D, explaining both Basic and Advanced versions. The Basic version demonstrates using built-in shader generation and postprocessing filters, while the Advanced version showcases custom Cg shaders for creating glow effects using alpha channels as glow maps.\n\"\"\"\n\nSample Programs: Glow Filter\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation of the 'Basic' Version\n\nThere are two versions of this program: Basic and Advanced. The Basic version relies on Panda3D's automatic shader generation mechanisms and Panda3D's built in catalog of image-postprocessing filters. In other words, in the Basic version, Panda3D is doing all the hard work for us. In the Advanced version, we have written our own shaders and are doing our own image postprocessing.\n\nSo what the basic version demonstrates is really just how to turn on the shader generation, how to turn on a 'light ramp' (the essence of cartoon shading), and how to turn on a built-in image postprocessing filter.\n\nExplanation of the 'Advanced' Version",
