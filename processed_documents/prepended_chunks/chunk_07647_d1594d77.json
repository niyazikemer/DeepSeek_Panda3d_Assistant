  "content": "The chunk situates itself as a section of the overall Panda3D API reference documentation, specifically detailing the structure and composition of the Python and C++ components of the API. It explains that the Panda3D Python API consists of two main packages\u2014the core library (panda3d) written in C++ and the direct library, which is a Python-based support library. Additionally, it provides information about the availability of C++ classes supporting these modules and mentions that the C++ part of the API reference is incomplete, with further details available through an external Doxygen reference.\n\nAPI Reference\n\npython\n\nThe Panda3D Python API consists of two packages: the panda3d core library, which is written in C++, and the direct library, which is written in Python. This section of the documentation aims to give a complete overview of all the classes and functions defined in these two libraries.\n\ncpp\n\nThe C++ part of the API reference is incomplete. Missing information can be looked up in the older Doxygen reference:\n\nhttps://www.panda3d.org/reference/cxx/\n\npanda3d direct\n\npanda3d - Core library\n\npanda3d\n\ndirect - Python support library\n\nDIRECT is a set of Python-based tools that are layered on top of core Panda3D, which is written in C++. It includes the DirectGUI tools, the task system, the Interval system, a high-level class for animated characters, and several other systems.\n\nThere are additional C++ classes to support these modules, which can be found in the panda3d.direct module.\n\npython\n\ndirect\n\ncpp",
