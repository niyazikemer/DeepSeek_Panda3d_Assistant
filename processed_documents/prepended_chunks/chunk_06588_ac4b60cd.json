  "content": "The chunk discusses alternative render modes for text fonts in Panda3D, specifically focusing on C++ syntax and available rendering options such as wireframe, polygon, and extruded surfaces. It also includes a warning about potential application crashes when using non-texture render modes with certain TTF fonts on Windows Vista.\n\ncpp\n\nOther available modes are TextFont::RM_wireframe, generating characters as polylines, TextFont::RM_polygon, generating characters as flat polygonal objects, and TextFont::RM_extruded, generating characters as extruded polygonal surfaces.\n\nWarning\n\nAt the time of the writing and with very few exceptions, nearly all tested TTF fonts available on Vista were compatible with the RMTexture render mode. However, many of the same fonts would crash the application if set to a different render mode such as TextFont.RMSolid. (Bug Report #383251)",
