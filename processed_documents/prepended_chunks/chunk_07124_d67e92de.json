  "content": "\"\"\"\nThe chunk describes the initial setup and implementation steps for integrating PandAI into a game. It explains how to import the library (Step 1), create an AIWorld object (Step 2), set up an update task (Step 3), test with a seek behavior using Ralph as a seeker and an arrow model as a target (Step 4), create an AICharacter object (Step 5), access AIBehaviors (Step 6), and call the seek function (Step 7). These steps are part of the 'Implementation' section in the document, which provides a step-by-step guide to getting started with PandAI.\n\"\"\"\n\nStep 1:\n\nTo use our AI library into your game you need to import PandAI into your game code via:\n\nfrom panda3d.ai import *\n\nStep 2:\n\nCreate an object of the AIWorld class which defines your AI in your game world.\n\nStep 3:\n\nSetup a task which runs continuously which keeps calling the 'Update()' function for your previously created AIWorld object\n\nStep 4:\n\nTo test this out let us also implement a simple call to the 'seek' behavior function in PandAI. To do this we need two objects: A seeker and a target. For this example, we will use Ralph (seeker) and an arrow model (target).\n\nStep 5:\n\nCreate an 'AICharacter' object and attach it to your AIWorld class (previously created). The AICharacter constructor looks for a NodePath, this can be a Model or an Actor or even an Empty NodePath.\n\nStep 6:\n\nGet a reference to the AIBehaviors object of your previously created AICharacter class via the 'getAiBehaviors' function().\n\nStep 7:",
