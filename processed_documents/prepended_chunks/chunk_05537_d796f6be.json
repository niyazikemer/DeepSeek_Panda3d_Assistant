  "content": "The provided chunk is from the beginning of `GridParent.py`, a Python module designed for handling objects parented to large grids (like an ocean grid) in a way that supports efficient 16-bit telemetry. The module introduces the `GridParent` class, which manages intermediate nodes between objects and grid cells to broadcast positions relative to their grid cell origins. It includes static methods for creating and releasing cell origin nodes, as well as managing object parent relationships with these nodes.\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nfrom panda3d.core import NodePath\n\n#\n# GridParent.py\n# Any object that can be parented to the ocean grid\n# (or any grid whose size is too large to represent in 16 bits),\n# should derive from GridParent.  Can be used on client and AI code.\n\n# GridParent will put a node inbetween the object and the grid so\n# that the object is broadcasting its position relative to the gridCell\n# it lies in.",
