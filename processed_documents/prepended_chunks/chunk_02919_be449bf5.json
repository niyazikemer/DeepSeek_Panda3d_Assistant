  "content": "The given chunk is part of a Python implementation of a ProjectileInterval class. This class inherits from Interval and is designed to move a nodepath along the trajectory of a projectile under gravitational influence. It uses constant velocity in X/Y directions and parabolic motion in Z due to gravity (defined as 32 units/s\u00b2). The class handles initialization, trajectory calculation, collision detection via CollisionParabola, and provides logging through notify.\n\nclass ProjectileInterval(Interval):\n    \"\"\"ProjectileInterval class: moves a nodepath through the trajectory\n    of a projectile under the influence of gravity\"\"\"\n\n    # create ProjectileInterval DirectNotify category\n    notify = directNotify.newCategory('ProjectileInterval')\n\n    # serial num for unnamed intervals\n    projectileIntervalNum = 1\n\n    # g ~ 9.8 m/s^2 ~ 32 ft/s^2\n    gravity = 32.\n\n    # the projectile's velocity is constant in the X and Y directions.\n    # the projectile's motion in the Z (up) direction is parabolic\n    # due to the constant force of gravity, which acts in the -Z direction",
