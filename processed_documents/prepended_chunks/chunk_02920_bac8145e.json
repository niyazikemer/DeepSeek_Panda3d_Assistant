  "content": "The given code chunk defines the `__init__` method of a class (likely related to physics-based animation or game development), which initializes a projectile interval with various parameters that determine the motion and behavior of a node over time. This constructor allows for flexible specification of the projectile's start position, end position, duration, initial velocity, endpoint at a specific Z-coordinate, waypoint passing, gravitational influence multiplier, and collision detection capabilities. The docstring explains that if `startPos` is not explicitly provided, it will be derived from the node's position when the interval starts, but in such cases, a duration must still be specified to define the motion properly.\n\nContext: This code is part of a system for simulating projectile motion with customizable parameters, enabling developers to define complex trajectories and interactions.\n\ndef __init__(self, node, startPos = None,\n                 endPos = None, duration = None,\n                 startVel = None, endZ = None,\n                 wayPoint = None, timeToWayPoint = None,\n                 gravityMult = None, name = None,\n                 collNode = None):\n        \"\"\"\n        You may specify several different sets of input parameters.\n        (If startPos is not provided, it will be obtained from the node's\n        position at the time that the interval is first started. Note that\n        in this case you must provide a duration of some kind.)",
