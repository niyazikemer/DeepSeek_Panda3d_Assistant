  "content": "This code chunk handles CPU affinity configuration during application setup. It checks if a client-side CPU affinity value has been set via configuration and adjusts it accordingly, defaulting to 0 under certain conditions. If an affinity value is specified, it applies the setting using `TrueClock.getGlobalPtr().setCpuAffinity()`, with special handling for Windows XP's 32-bit affinity mask compatibility.\n\nelse:\n                affinity = ConfigVariableInt('client-cpu-affinity', -1).value\n            if (affinity in (None, -1)) and autoAffinity:\n                affinity = 0\n            if affinity is not None and affinity != -1:\n                # Windows XP supports a 32-bit affinity mask\n                TrueClock.getGlobalPtr().setCpuAffinity(1 << (affinity % 32))",
