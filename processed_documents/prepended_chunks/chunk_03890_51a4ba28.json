  "content": "The given code chunk is situated within the implementation details of a TaskManager class designed for managing asynchronous tasks in Python. Specifically, the chunk pertains to the setup of ownership and death callbacks for tasks, followed by a method that allows removing one or more tasks from the manager based on their name or task object reference.\n\nif owner is not None:\n            task.setOwner(owner)\n\n        if uponDeath is not None:\n            task.setUponDeath(uponDeath)\n\n        return task\n\n    def remove(self, taskOrName: AsyncTask | str | list[AsyncTask | str]) -> int:\n        \"\"\"Removes a task from the task manager.  The task is stopped,\n        almost as if it had returned task.done.  (But if the task is\n        currently executing, it will finish out its current frame\n        before being removed.)  You may specify either an explicit\n        Task object, or the name of a task.  If you specify a name,\n        all tasks with the indicated name are removed.  Returns the\n        number of tasks removed. \"\"\"",
