  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a method within the `TexManager` class that initializes the texture management system. It calculates the width (`w`) and height (`h`) of the canvas based on the quantize value, ensuring they are at least 1 unit. It then sets up bitmasks for each row to track allocated space efficiently. The canvas is scaled appropriately, and the mouse watcher region is configured. Finally, texture records are sorted by size in descending order to optimize packing effectiveness before placing each texture.\n\nContext: This code initializes the `TexManager`'s canvas dimensions, prepares data structures for efficient space tracking, configures input handling, and sorts textures for optimal placement during the initialization phase of the texture management system.\n\nw = max(int(w / self.quantize + 0.5), 1)\n        h = max(int(h / self.quantize + 0.5), 1)\n        self.w = w\n        self.h = h\n        self.area = self.w * self.h\n\n        # We store a bitarray for each row, for fast lookup for\n        # unallocated space on the canvas.  Each Q-unit on the row\n        # corresponds to a bit in the bitarray, where bit 0 is Q-unit\n        # 0, bit 1 is Q-unit 1, and so on.
