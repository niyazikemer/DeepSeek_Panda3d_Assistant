  "content": "The chunk is an introductory setup section from a Panda3D-based implementation that demonstrates how to create a character capable of navigating uneven terrain using PandAI pathfinding. It includes essential imports, initializes the base ShowBase instance, and defines key constants for speed control. This section sets up the foundational environment for the rest of the implementation, which involves creating a rotatable camera system and implementing AI-driven movement for the character on the terrain.\n\n# PandAI Author: Srinavin Nair\n# Original Author: Ryan Myers\n# Models: Jeff Styers, Reagan Heller\n\n# Last Updated: 6/13/2005\n#\n# This tutorial provides an example of creating a character and having it walk\n# around on uneven terrain, as well as implementing a fully rotatable camera.\n# It uses PandAI pathfinding to move the character.\n\nfrom direct.showbase.ShowBase import ShowBase\nfrom panda3d.core import CollisionTraverser, CollisionNode\nfrom panda3d.core import CollisionHandlerQueue, CollisionRay\nfrom panda3d.core import Filename\nfrom panda3d.core import PandaNode, NodePath, TextNode\nfrom panda3d.core import Vec3, BitMask32\nfrom direct.gui.OnscreenText import OnscreenText\nfrom direct.actor.Actor import Actor\nfrom direct.task.Task import Task\nfrom direct.showbase.DirectObject import DirectObject\nimport sys\nimport os\n\nfrom panda3d.ai import *\n\nbase = ShowBase()\n\nSPEED = 0.5",
