  "content": "The `AnimControlInterval` class is part of an animation system designed to play and control animations over a specified time interval. The chunk describes the purpose of the class, which is to handle the playback of animations using either a single `AnimControl` or a collection of anim controls (`AnimControlCollection`) where each must have the same length. It explains how animations can be played over a specific frame range or time span, and how durations are handled (either implicitly calculated from the animation's frame count or explicitly specified by the user). The class also manages the efficient updating of animation poses during playback.\n\nclass AnimControlInterval(Interval.Interval):\n\n    # create AnimControlInterval DirectNotify category\n    notify = directNotify.newCategory('AnimControlInterval')\n\n    # Name counter\n    animNum = 1\n    # Class methods\n\n    # Plays an animation.  The subrange of the animation\n    # to be played may be specified via frames (startFrame up to and\n    # including endFrame) or seconds (startTime up to and including\n    # endTime).  If neither is specified, the default is the entire\n    # range of the animation.\n\n    # this class requires either an AnimControl, or an AnimControlCollection\n    # (in which case, each anim control must be the same length)\n\n    # The duration may be implicit or explicit.  If it is omitted, it\n    # is taken to be endTime - startTime.  There's not much point in\n    # specifying otherwise unless you also specify loop=1, which will\n    # loop the animation over its frame range during the duration of\n    # the interval.",
