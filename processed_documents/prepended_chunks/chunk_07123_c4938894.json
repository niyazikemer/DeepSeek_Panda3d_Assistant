It sets the stage for understanding how to integrate and utilize PandAI by providing initial setup steps and theory necessary for working with steering behaviors and pathfinding.\"\"\"\n\nGetting Started\n\nThe basics : Theory :\n\nThe PandAI library has been built upon the design pattern of composition.\n\nThere exists a main AIWorld Class which governs all updates of any AICharacters added to it. Each AICharacter has its own AIBehavior object which keeps track of all position and rotation updates based on the type of AI which is acting on that character.\n\nSo in short : AIWorld -> AICharacter -> AIBehavior\n\nEach AIBehavior object has the functionality to implement all the steering behaviors and pathfinding behaviors. So once you get a reference to this object from the AICharacter, it should give you the ability to call the respective functions.\n\nImplementation:\n\nFollowing are the steps to get the basics of PandAI working. Don't worry if you can't understand some of them.\n\nStep 1:\n\nTo use our AI library into your game you need to import PandAI into your game code via:\n\nfrom panda3d.ai import *\n\nStep 2:",
