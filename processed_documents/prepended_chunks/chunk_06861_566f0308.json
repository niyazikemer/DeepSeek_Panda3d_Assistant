  "content": "The chunk describes configuration variables related to texture management in hardware-accelerated rendering, including global scaling factors and power-of-two constraints.\n\non normal, hardware-accelerated renderers. See\nTexture::set_quality_level(). texture-scale double 1.0 This is a global scale factor that is applied to each texture as it\nis loaded from disk. For instance, a value of 0.5 will reduce each\ntexture to one-half its size in each dimension. This scale factor is\napplied before textures-power-2 or max-texture-dimension. texture-scale-limit int 4 This specifies the limit below which texture-scale will not reduce a\ntexture image. This is a single dimension which applies to both X and\nY. textures-auto-power-2 bool 0 If this is true, then panda will wait until you open a window, and\nthen ask the window if it supports non-power-of-two textures. If so,\nthen the config variable textures_power_2 will automatically be\nadjusted. The pitfall of doing this is that if you then open a second\nwindow that doesn't support the same capabilities, it will have no",
