  "content": "This section explains the process of creating AI server-side managed objects, detailing how they are distributed to clients with specific class conventions. It provides an example of instantiating such an object on the AI server using a particular class and zone ID.\n\nAI-side Created Objects\n\nSimilar to the client-side created objects, AI server-side created objects will be created and managed on the AI server. The difference is that the classes with the AI suffix will be used to create the DistributedObject. The respective class without the AI suffix will be created on clients that stated with the AI appending will usually be used for creation and hence the AI functionality of those nodes can be accessed. Those objects will also be distributed to the clients.\n\nAn example for creating an AI object directly on the AI server follows.\n\nself.gameDistObjectAI = self.createDistributedObject(\n    className = 'DGameObjectAI',\n    zoneId = 2)",
