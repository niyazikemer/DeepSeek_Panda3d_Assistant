  "content": "The faces of a cube map are arranged in a specific spatial layout corresponding to six cardinal directions (+u, -u, +v, -v, +w, -w). The chunk explains the orientation and arrangement of these faces when folded into a cube, including how some faces may appear upside-down or sideways due to graphics card conventions and Panda3D's coordinate system. It also discusses the dual nature of cube maps as both surface textures and volumetric textures, where each point in 3D space is colored based on the closest face of the cube.\n\nThe faces are laid out according to the following diagram:\n\nImagine that you cut out the above diagram and folded it into a cube. You'd end up with something like this:\n\nNote that, when you hold the cube so that the axis indications for each face are in the appropriate direction (as in the picture above), several of the faces are upside-down or sideways. That's because of the way the graphics card manufacturers decided to lay out the cube map faces (and also because of Panda3D's default coordinate system). But in fact, it doesn't matter which way the faces are oriented, as long as you always generate your cube map images the same way.\n\nIn some sense, a cube map is a kind of surface texture, like an ordinary 2-D texture. But in another sense, it is also volumetric like a 3-D texture: every point within the 3-D texture coordinate space is colored according to the face of the cube it comes closest to. A sphere model with the cube map applied to it would pick up the same six faces:",
