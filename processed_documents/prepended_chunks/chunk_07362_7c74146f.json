  "content": "The provided chunk serves as an introductory explanation within the overall documentation on DirectGui objects. It situates the fundamental structure and creation process of these objects, detailing their common components such as text, geom, image, and frame, along with how text is managed using OnScreenText. This section precedes more specific examples like buttons and sliders, establishing a foundational understanding necessary for comprehending subsequent detailed explanations.\n\nAll of the DirectGui objects are constructed in a similar way:\n\nfrom direct.gui.DirectGui import *\nmyObject = Directxxxxxx(keyword=value, keyword=value, ...)\n\nEach DirectGui object may contain any of four fundamental pieces that determine its appearance. There may be an optional text, an optional geom, an optional image, and an optional frame.\n\nA DirectGui's text label may be any arbitrary text string, and whatever text string you supply is automatically created using the onscreentext interface and centered on the object. You can specify the text string using the text keyword. You can also specify further parameters to control the appearance or placement of the text using the form text_parameter, where parameter is any valid keyword to the onscreentext constructor.",
