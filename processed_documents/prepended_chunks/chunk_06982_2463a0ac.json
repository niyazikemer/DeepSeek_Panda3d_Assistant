  "content": "This chunk is situated in the section titled **General Preparation** under the main topic of preparing to use Panda3D. Specifically, it falls under the subsection discussing **Python**, where it provides details about how Panda3D includes a copy of Python for Windows users, mentions that macOS already has Python 2.7 pre-installed, and explains what happens if you already have a copy of Python installed on your system.\n\nThe Copy of Python that comes with Panda\n\nOn Windows, it is not necessary to install Python, because the Windows installer for Panda3D includes a copy. This is a completely normal copy of Python, identical to what you would have if you installed Python using the standard Python installer. Panda's built-in copy of Python is automatically added to the PATH environment variable. This enables you to type \"python\" at the command prompt, and it will run the Python that comes with Panda.\n\nOn macOS, Python 2.7 already comes pre-installed on your system, which will work with Panda3D. However, it is recommended to install a newer version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ .\n\nWhat if I already have a copy of Python?",
