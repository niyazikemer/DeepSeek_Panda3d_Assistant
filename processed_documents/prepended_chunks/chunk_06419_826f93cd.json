  "content": "The provided code chunk demonstrates how to adjust the texture generation for a cube map in Panda3D from MEyeCubeMap to MWorldCubeMap, enabling dynamic reflection that varies with the camera's viewpoint during runtime. This modification addresses the limitation of fixed-point-of-view reflections inherent in sphere mapping by utilizing pre-rendered images to simulate real-time changes.\n\ntex = loader.loadCubeMap('streetscene_cube_#.jpg')\nteapot.setTexGen(TextureStage.getDefault(), TexGenAttrib.MWorldCubeMap)\nteapot.setTexture(tex)\n\nBy changing MEyeCubeMap to MWorldCubeMap, we have indicated that we would like this cube map to vary its point-of-view as the camera moves. Now the reflected environment will vary according to the direction we are looking at it, so that it shows what is behind the camera at runtime, instead of always showing the area behind the camera when the cube map was generated, as a sphere map must do. In order for this to work properly, you should ensure that your camera is unrotated (that is, set_hpr(0, 0, 0) <.NodePath.set_hpr>) when you generate the cube map initially.\n\nEven with MWorldCubeMap, though, the image is still generated ahead of time, so the reflection doesn't actually show what is behind the camera at runtime. It just uses the current camera direction to figure out what part of the reflection image to show.",
