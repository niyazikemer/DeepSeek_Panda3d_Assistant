This means that the output will\nbe properly gamma-corrected, as long as all the input textures are\neither converted from original sRGB to linear or sRGB textures are\nused. framebuffer-stencil bool 0 True if FM_stencil should be added to the default framebuffer\nproperties, which requests an stencil buffer if possible. framebuffer-stereo bool 0 True if FM_stereo should be added to the default framebuffer\nproperties, which requests a stereo-capable display, if supported by the",
