  "content": "The chunk discusses other file formats not directly supported by Panda3D's main importers and explains the process of converting them to the Egg format using built-in tools like flt2egg, highlighting the role of the p3ptloader plugin.\n\nOther Formats\n\nOther file formats need to be converted first to a supported format. Panda3D provides various utilities that can be used to convert models to the Egg format <converting-to-egg>.\n\nFor several formats for which Panda3D ships with a to-egg conversion tool, Panda3D can automatically do the step of converting the model to .egg on load. For example, Panda3D ships with a flt2egg converter, which can convert OpenFlight models to the Egg format. If you try to load a .flt file, Panda3D will implicitly invoke flt2egg behind the scenes. The plug-in responsible for this is called p3ptloader.",
