  "content": "The `flush` method in the CRCache class is responsible for clearing all cached items. It iterates through each cached distributed object, initiates their deletion process, handles objects that might be delayed in deletion, ensures proper cleanup by sending a 'clientCleanup' message, checks for any remaining delay deletions, and verifies there are no memory leaks. This method is crucial for resetting the cache state and maintaining application integrity.\n\ndef flush(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Delete each item in the cache then clear all references to them\n        \"\"\"\n        assert self.checkCache()\n        CRCache.notify.debug(\"Flushing the cache\")\n        # NOTE: delayDeleted objects should no longer get into the cache in the first place\n        # give objects a chance to clean themselves up before checking for DelayDelete leaks\n        messenger.send('clientCleanup')\n        # some of these objects might be holding delayDeletes on others\n        # track each object that is delayDeleted after it gets its chance to delete,\n        # and check them after all objects have had a chance to delete\n        delayDeleted = []\n        for distObj in self.dict.values():\n            distObj.deleteOrDelay()\n            if distObj.getDelayDeleteCount() != 0:\n                delayDeleted.append(distObj)\n            if distObj.getDelayDeleteCount() <= 0:\n                # make sure we're not leaking\n                distObj.detectLeaks()",
