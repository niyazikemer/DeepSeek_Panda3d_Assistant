The specific method shown retrieves a list of object IDs (`doId`) based on a parent ID, an optional zone ID, and an optional class type filter. This ensures that objects are correctly located and tracked within the system's hierarchy.\n\nIf dclassName is None then all objects in the zone are returned;\n        otherwise the list is filtered to only include objects of that type.\n        \"\"\"\n        parent=self._table.get(parentId)\n        if parent is None:\n            return []\n        if zoneId is None:\n            r = []\n            for zone in parent.values():\n                for obj in zone:\n                    r.append(obj)\n        else:\n            r = parent.get(zoneId, [])\n        if classType is not None:\n            a = []\n            for doId in r:\n                obj = getDo(doId)\n                if isinstance(obj, classType):\n                    a.append(doId)\n            r = a\n        return r",
