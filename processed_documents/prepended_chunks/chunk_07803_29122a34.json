  "content": "This section describes several third-party libraries used by the software, including optimized linear algebra libraries for improved matrix operations, libsquish for texture compression support, and libraries for handling image formats like TIFF and OpenEXR. It also includes platform-specific components such as DirectX for Windows and X libraries for Linux/FreeBSD.\n\nOptimized linear algebra library. Optional, but improves performance of matrix operations significantly.\n\nLicense: MPL2\n\nlibsquish\n\nhttps://code.google.com/archive/p/libsquish/\n\nLibsquish gives DXT support. This improves Panda's support for pre-compressed texture images such as dds files, and it allows Panda to streamline compression of textures images at load time. However, even without this library, Panda can still compress and use compressed textures, by relying on the interfaces built into your graphics driver.\n\nLicense: MIT License\n\nlibtiff\n\nhttp://libtiff.org/\n\nTiff image format support.\n\nLicense: libtiff license\n\nOpenEXR\n\nhttps://www.openexr.com/\n\nOpenEXR image format support. New in 1.10.\n\nLicense: Modified BSD license\n\nDirectX (Windows only)\n\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/default.aspx\n\nWindows DirectX libraries.\n\nLicense: Proprietary\n\nX libraries (Linux/FreeBSD only)\n\nhttps://www.x.org/wiki/",
