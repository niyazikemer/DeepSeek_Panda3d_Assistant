  "content": "The document explains how Panda3D's default camera driver works and provides methods for controlling the camera using keyboard or mouse inputs. After discussing the use of `base.useDrive()` and `base.useTrackball()` commands, it introduces the `base.oobe()` method, which allows users to control the basic camera node with the mouse/trackball while debugging their application, providing a \"God's-eye view\" perspective.\n\nbase.useDrive()\nbase.useTrackball()\n\nShowBase also provides the method ~direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.oobe() to give you to control of the basic camera node (base.cam) with the mouse/trackball while the code continues to move the camera node (base.camera). This can be useful for debugging purposes. The word stands for \"out-of-body experience\" and is handy for giving you a God's-eye view of your application at any point in development. The method is a toggle; call it once to enable OOBE mode, and then again to disable it.\n\nbase.oobe()",
