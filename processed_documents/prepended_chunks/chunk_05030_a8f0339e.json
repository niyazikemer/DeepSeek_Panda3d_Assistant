  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a function in a Python script designed to create a mirror effect in a 3D scene using Panda3D. The function `setupMirror` creates an offscreen buffer for rendering the mirror's perspective and sets up a camera with the specified dimensions, attaching it to a plane node to capture the reflected view.\n\nContext: This code is responsible for initializing the graphical components needed for the mirror effect by creating an offscreen buffer to render the mirrored scene and configuring a camera to capture this reflection.\n\n# Now create an offscreen buffer for rendering the mirror's point\n    # of view.  The parameters here control the resolution of the\n    # texture.\n    buffer = base.win.makeTextureBuffer(name, bufferSize, bufferSize)\n    if clearColor is None:\n        buffer.setClearColor(base.win.getClearColor())\n        #buffer.setClearColor(VBase4(0, 0, 1, 1))\n    else:\n        buffer.setClearColor(clearColor)\n\n    # Set up a display region on this buffer, and create a camera.\n    dr = buffer.makeDisplayRegion()\n    camera = Camera('mirrorCamera')\n    lens = PerspectiveLens()\n    lens.setFilmSize(width, height)\n    camera.setLens(lens)\n    cameraNP = planeNP.attachNewNode(camera)\n    dr.setCamera(cameraNP)",
