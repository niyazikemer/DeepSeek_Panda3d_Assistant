  "content": "The chunk describes the definition of texture files and material attributes in Panda's file format, including scalar values for diffuse, ambient, emissive, and specular properties. This information is situated within a comprehensive document explaining various aspects of defining 3D models and animations in Panda, including groups, joints, bundles, tables, and vertex pools.\n\nContext: The chunk defines texture and material attributes in Panda's file format, following the explanation of vertex pools, to describe how geometry can be shaded and textured.\n\nTextures\n\nThis describes a texture file that can be referenced later with <TRef> { name }:\n\n<Texture> name {\n  filename\n  <Scalar> scalar1 { value1 }\n  <Scalar> scalar2 { value2 }\n}\n\nTexture Scalars\n\nThe following attributes are presently implemented for textures:\n\nMaterials\n\nThis defines a set of material attributes that may later be referenced with <MRef> { name }:\n\n<Material> name {\n  [scalars]\n}\n\nMaterial Scalars\n\n<Scalar>\u00a0diffr\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0diffg\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0diffb\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0diffa\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0ambr\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0ambg\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0ambb\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0amba\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0emitr\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0emitg\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0emitb\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0emita\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0specr\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0specg\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0specb\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0speca\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0shininess\u00a0{\u00a0number\u00a0}\n<Scalar>\u00a0local\u00a0{\u00a0flag\u00a0}\n\nVertex Pool",
