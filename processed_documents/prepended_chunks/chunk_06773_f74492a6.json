  "content": "This chunk is situated within the section of the document detailing various configuration options related to Panda3D's rendering system, specifically focusing on OpenGL-related settings. The variables discussed here (`gl-cheap-textures`, `gl-check-errors`, `gl-color-mask`, `gl-compile-and-execute`) pertain to optimizing and troubleshooting graphics performance, particularly for older or specific hardware configurations. These options are part of a broader set of tools for fine-tuning Panda3D's interaction with OpenGL drivers and can significantly impact rendering efficiency and correctness.\n\nin Panda3D versions 1.9 and earlier. If false (the default), uses the\ncorrect calculation. gl-cheap-textures bool 0 Configure this true to glHint the textures into the cheapest\npossible mode. gl-check-errors bool 0 Regularly call glGetError() to check for OpenGL errors. This will\nslow down rendering significantly. If your video driver supports it, you\nshould use gl-debug instead. gl-color-mask bool 1 Configure this false if your GL's implementation of glColorMask() is\nbroken (some are). This will force the use of a (presumably) more\nexpensive blending operation instead. gl-compile-and-execute bool 0 Configure this true if you know your GL's implementation of\nglNewList(n, GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE) works. It is false by default,\nsince it is known to cause a crash with Intel 855GM driver 4.14.10.3889\nat least.
