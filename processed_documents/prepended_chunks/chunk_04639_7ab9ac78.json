  "content": "These functions are utilities for boolean comparison and positioning calculations within a collection of objects.\n\nSuccinct Context:\n\nThe chunk contains two utility functions: `boolEqual` which checks if two booleans have the same truth value (both true or both false), and `lineupPos` which calculates the position of an object in a centered one-dimensional lineup. These functions are added to the collection of utility functions in the document, enhancing its capabilities for boolean operations and spatial arrangement calculations.\n\n```python\ndef boolEqual(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns true if a and b are both true or both false.\n    returns false otherwise\n    (a.ka.xnor -- eXclusive Not OR).\n    \"\"\"\n    return (a and b) or not (a or b)\n\n\ndef lineupPos(i, num, spacing):\n    \"\"\"\n    use to line up a series of 'num' objects, in one dimension,\n    centered around zero.\n    'i' is the index of the object in the lineup\n    'spacing' is the amount of space between objects in the lineup\n    \"\"\"\n    assert num >= 1\n    assert i >= 0 and i < num\n    pos = float(i) * spacing\n    return pos - ((float(spacing) * (num-1))/2.)\n```\n\ndef boolEqual(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns true if a and b are both true or both false.\n    returns false otherwise\n    (a.k.a. xnor -- eXclusive Not OR).\n    \"\"\"\n    return (a and b) or not (a or b)\n\n\ndef lineupPos(i, num, spacing):\n    \"\"\"\n    use to line up a series of 'num' objects, in one dimension,\n    centered around zero\n    'i' is the index of the object in the lineup\n    'spacing' is the amount of space between objects in the lineup\n    \"\"\"\n    assert num >= 1\n    assert i >= 0 and i < num\n    pos = float(i) * spacing\n    return pos - ((float(spacing) * (num-1))/2.)",
