  "content": "The `FindContainers` class is a job subclass within the provided codebase that facilitates the exploration of the Python object graph. Its purpose is to identify and collect objects that support the `__len__()` method, enabling subsequent processing for tasks such as leak checking and container management. This class plays a crucial role in initializing the discovery phase of containers, which are then further analyzed by other components like `CheckContainers` and `PruneObjectRefs` within the system's workflow.\n\nclass FindContainers(Job):\n    \"\"\"\n    Explore the Python graph, looking for objects that support __len__()\n    \"\"\"",
