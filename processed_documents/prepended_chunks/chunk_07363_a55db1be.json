  "content": "The chunk explains how to customize the appearance of DirectGui objects by using a NodePath as their geom parameter, allowing developers to create highly customized visual elements for GUI components.\n\nA DirectGui's geom can be any NodePath that you design, to represent the appearance of the gui object. Typically, this will be a model that you created via the program egg-texture-cards. This little program takes a png or other picture and turns it into an egg. See automatic-texture-animation for more details. Using this interface, you can completely customize the look of the DirectGui object to suit your needs. You can specify the geom object using the geom keyword, and like the text parameter, you can also control the geom's placement using keywords like geom_parameter.",
