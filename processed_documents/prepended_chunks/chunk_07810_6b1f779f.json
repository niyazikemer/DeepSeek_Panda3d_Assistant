  "content": "The chunk discusses licensing information for the Virtual-Reality Peripheral Network (VRPN), followed by build tools Bison and Flex used for compilation, and addresses patent restrictions related to MP3 and MPEG formats. It concludes with recommendations for using free alternative audio and video formats such as Ogg Vorbis, Opus, and Ogg Theora within the context of libraries and tools relevant to Panda3D.\n\nPrior versions were released into the public domain.\n\nBuild Tools (for compilation only)\n\nBison\n\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/bison/\n\nGeneral-purpose parser generator.\n\nFlex\n\nhttp://flex.sourceforge.net/\n\nThe Fast Lexical Analyzer.\n\nPatent Restriction Issues\n\nMP3\n\nMPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3), while commonly used and since 2017 with expired patent and licensing, is recommended against. More modern and better suited audio encodings have been developed and should be used instead.\n\nMPEG\n\nOther MPEG related formats are restricted by patents as well. Finding the prices of licenses for these formats is not even as easy as it was with MP3.\n\nRecommended Alternatives\n\nFree alternatives exist and are highly encouraged. These formats include Ogg Vorbis (lossy), Opus (lossy) and Ogg FLAC (lossless) for audio, and Ogg Theora for video.",
