  "content": "The chunk describes the initialization of a state management system within the `FourStateAI` class, where each state has an associated 'on' or 'off' value. The code sets up five states with specific durations and transitions, using a State library for state handling and task scheduling for timed state changes.\n\nEach states also has an associated on or off value.  The only\n        state that is 'on' is state 4.  So, the transition states\n        between off and on (states 1 and 3) are also considered\n        off (and so is state 2 which is oposite of state 4 and therefore\n        oposite of 'on').\n        \"\"\"\n        self.stateIndex = 0\n        assert self.__debugPrint(\n                \"FourStateAI(names=%s, durations=%s)\"\n                %(names, durations))\n        self.doLaterTask = None\n        assert len(names) == 5\n        assert len(names) == len(durations)\n        self.names = names\n        self.durations = durations\n        self.states = {\n            0: State.State(names[0],\n                           self.enterState0,\n                           self.exitState0,\n                           [names[1],\n                           names[2],\n                           names[3],\n                           names[4]]),\n            1: State.State(names[1],",
