  "content": "The chunk discusses PStats-related configuration options, including task tracking, network transmission settings (TCP/UDP), threaded writes, and unused states visualization. These settings are part of performance monitoring and data collection parameters within the software.\n\nContext: This section is about configuring PStats, a tool for profiling application performance, which includes options to track tasks, control data transmission methods, enable background writing, and display statistics on unused states, affecting overhead and data accuracy in performance analysis.\n\nframe rate is marked with a different-colored line; otherwise, this\nsetting has no effect. pstats-tasks bool 0 pstats-tcp-ratio double 0.01 This specifies the ratio of frame update messages that are eligible\nfor UDP that are sent via TCP instead. It does not count messages that\nare too large for UDP and must be sent via TCP anyway. 1.0 means all\nmessages are sent TCP; 0.0 means all are sent UDP. pstats-threaded-write bool 1 Set this true to write to the PStats channel in a sub-thread, if\nthreading is available. Can't think of any reason why you wouldn't want\nthis set true, unless you suspect something is broken with the threaded\nnetwork interfaces. pstats-unused-states bool 0 Set this true to show the number of unused states in the pstats\ngraph for TransformState and RenderState counts. This adds a bit of\nper-frame overhead to count these things up. ptloader-load-node bool 1 Specify true to allow libptloader to invoke the more efficient but",
