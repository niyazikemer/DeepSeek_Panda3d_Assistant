  "content": "This chunk is situated at the beginning of the document, introducing the use of `GeomVertexReader` and `GeomVertexWriter` classes in Panda3D. It explains that these classes are designed for temporary data manipulation tasks and should not be stored persistently due to their pointer nature. The section also lists the available methods for reading and writing vertex data, setting the stage for subsequent discussions on advanced operations like rewriting vertex attributes.\n\ncolor = GeomVertexReader(vdata, 'color')\n\nBecause the GeomVertexReader and GeomVertexWriter classes only store a temporary pointer, which might become invalid between frames or even between different tasks within a frame, these objects should not be stored in any persistent object. Instead, they are designed to be temporary objects that are constructed locally, used immediately to iterate through a list of vertices, and then released. If you need to keep a persistent iterator for your vertex data, to be used over a long period of time (e.g. over several frames), then you should store just the GeomVertexData pointer (along with the current vertex index number if you require this), and construct a temporary GeomVertexReader/Writer each time you need to access it.\n\nThe following methods are available to read and write data in a column:",
