  "content": "The chunk is part of a guide explaining how to systematically identify and address performance bottlenecks in 3D rendering applications. It outlines the process of diagnosing slowdowns using tools like PStats, optimizing identified issues, and highlights common bugs as a frequent cause of performance problems.\n\nDiagnose the problem: isolate the cause of the slowdown. This can be done by disabling parts of the game until you find one that has a significant effect on the frame rate, but a more sophisticated method is to use the PStats <measuring-performance-with-pstats> performance analysis tool, which will tell you exactly how much time the different parts of the game are contributing to your frame time.\n\nOptimize the bottleneck: once you have isolated the part of your application that is making it slow, you can take steps to mitigate it. The page common-performance-issues contains a list of commonly occurring bottlenecks, each with an associated page explaining each issue in more detail together with possible solutions.\n\nRepeat these steps as long as your frame time is exceeding your budget.\n\nMost Common Problem: Silly Little Bugs",
