  "content": "The chunk appears in a section about diagnosing and optimizing game performance. It follows steps for identifying and mitigating bottlenecks using tools like PStats. The context highlights that after addressing these issues, performance problems are often caused by small, overlooked bugs rather than major design flaws, as illustrated by the example of accumulated text objects leading to inefficiency.\n\nSuccinct Context:\nThe chunk discusses the iterative process of optimizing game performance and emphasizes that most common issues stem from simple, destructive bugs, such as the example of accumulating text objects causing slowdowns.\n\nRepeat these steps as long as your frame time is exceeding your budget.\n\nMost Common Problem: Silly Little Bugs\n\nWhen people start performance tuning, they often start with the assumption that there's something serious wrong with the engine, or the design of the game. In my experience, however, 90% of the time the problem is that the game contains a silly (but destructive) bug. Here are some examples of bugs that I have seen:\n\nA game had a text readout in the corner of the screen, which got updated every frame. But they updated the text by creating a new text object, and forgot to remove the old text object. So the corner of the screen contained thousands of layers of accumulated messages.",
