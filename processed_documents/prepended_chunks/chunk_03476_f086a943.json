  "content": "The provided code chunk belongs to a class hierarchy designed for managing collision detection in 3D environments using Panda3D. Specifically, it's part of a `SphereSelectionQueue` subclass within a broader `SelectionQueue` framework. This subclass handles sphere-based collisions, enabling methods to adjust the sphere's center and radius, determine if a collision is from the backface of a surface, and execute collision detection operations.\n\n### Context:\n- **Class Purpose**: Manages sphere-based collision detection.\n- **Key Methods**:\n  - `setCenterRadius()`: Adjusts sphere position and size.\n  - `isEntryBackfacing()`: Checks if a collision is from the backside using vector math.\n  - `pick()`: Initiates collision traversal and processing.\n\nThis context highlights the chunk's role in enabling precise collision handling for spheres, focusing on geometry adjustments and backface detection.\n\ndef setCenterRadius(self, i, center, radius):\n        c = self.colliders[i]\n        c.setCenter(center)\n        c.setRadius(radius)\n\n    def isEntryBackfacing(self, entry):\n        # If dot product of collision point surface normal and\n        # ray from sphere origin to collision point is positive,\n        # center is on the backside of the polygon\n        fromNodePath = entry.getFromNodePath()\n        v = Vec3(entry.getSurfacePoint(fromNodePath) -\n                 entry.getFrom().getCenter())\n        n = entry.getSurfaceNormal(fromNodePath)\n        # If points almost on top of each other, reject face\n        # (treat as backfacing)\n        if v.length() < 0.05:\n            return 1\n        # Normalize and check angle between to vectors\n        v.normalize()\n        return v.dot(n) >= 0\n\n    def pick(self, targetNodePath, skipFlags):\n        self.ct.traverse(targetNodePath)\n        self.sortEntries()\n        return self.findCollisionEntry(skipFlags)",
