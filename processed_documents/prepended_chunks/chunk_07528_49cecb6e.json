  "content": "This chunk provides guidance on how to apply a created RenderEffect to either the entire scene or specific objects by setting it on the appropriate NodePath, along with code examples for Python and C++.\n\nOnce you have created a RenderEffect, you need to decide what it should affect. If you have an effect that should affect everything in the scene the NodePath in the next line of code is \"render\". If you only want it to affect specific objects, choose the appropriate place in the scene graph.\n\npython\n\nnodePath.node().setEffect(<Render Effect>)\n\ncpp\n\nnodePath.node()->set_effect(<Render Effect>);\n\nbillboard compass",
