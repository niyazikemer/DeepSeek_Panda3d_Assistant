  "content": "The provided chunk is a method named `mouseDollyStart` within the `DirectManipulation` class. This method handles the initiation of dolly (zooming) operations when specific mouse events occur, particularly utilizing Maya-style camera controls with modifier keys. It is part of a larger system managing 3D viewport interactions, where it hides visual markers and spawns tasks for orthographic or perspective zooming based on user input and current camera settings.\n\ndef mouseDollyStart(self, modifiers):\n        if self.useMayaCamControls and modifiers == 4: # alt is pressed - use maya controls\n            # Hide the marker for this kind of motion\n            self.coaMarker.hide()\n            # Record time of start of mouse interaction\n            base = ShowBaseGlobal.base\n            self.startT = base.clock.getFrameTime()\n            self.startF = base.clock.getFrameCount()\n            # If the cam is orthogonal, spawn differentTask\n            direct = ShowBaseGlobal.direct\n            if hasattr(direct, \"manipulationControl\") and \\\n               direct.manipulationControl.fMultiView and \\\n               direct.camera.getName() != 'persp':\n                self.spawnOrthoZoom()\n            else:\n                # Start manipulation\n                self.spawnHPanYZoom()",
