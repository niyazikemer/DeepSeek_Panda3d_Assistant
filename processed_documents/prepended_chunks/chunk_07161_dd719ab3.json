  "content": "The chunk is part of a section explaining how to manage buffer clearing and rendering order for overlapping `DisplayRegion`s in Panda3D. It begins with C++ methods for enabling depth buffer clears, mentions optional auxiliary buffer controls via `DrawableRegion`, then transitions into the importance of specifying drawing order using `set_sort()` when regions overlap.\n\nContext: After discussing color and depth buffer management, the section addresses controlling rendering order for overlapping `DisplayRegion`s through sorting.\n\ncpp\n\nwin->set_clear_depth_active(flag);\nwin->set_clear_depth(depthValue);\n\nThe depthValue should almost always be 1.0, which is the default.\n\nIt is also possible to selectively clear the stencil buffer, and other auxiliary buffers, in a similar way. See the generated API docs for .DrawableRegion for more information.\n\nSorting\n\nNote that when you are overlapping DisplayRegions, it becomes very important to specify the order in which the DisplayRegions should be drawn. To do this, use ~.DisplayRegion.set_sort():\n\npython\n\ndr.setSort(sortValue)\n\ncpp\n\ndr->set_sort(sortValue);\n\nThe sortValue can be any integer number; the default is zero. All DisplayRegions for a particular window will be drawn in order from smallest sort first to largest sort last. If two DisplayRegions have the same sort value, the order in which they are drawn is undefined.",
