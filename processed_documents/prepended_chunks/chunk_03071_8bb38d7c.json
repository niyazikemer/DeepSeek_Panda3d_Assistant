  "content": "The provided code defines methods for managing Levels of Detail (LOD) and animation optimization in an Actor class. The `hasLOD` method checks if the actor has any LODs configured, while `setLODAnimation` enables a mode where animation frequency decreases with distance from the camera, optimizing performance for distant objects. This chunk is part of a larger document detailing an Actor class interface for 3D graphics or game development, focusing on methods for managing model complexity and animation efficiency based on distance from the viewer.\n\ndef hasLOD(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return 1 if the actor has LODs, 0 otherwise\n        \"\"\"\n        return self.__hasLOD\n\n    def setCenter(self, center):\n        if center is None:\n            center = Point3(0, 0, 0)\n        self.__LODCenter = center\n        if self.__LODNode:\n            self.__LODNode.node().setCenter(self.__LODCenter)\n        if self.__LODAnimation:\n            self.setLODAnimation(*self.__LODAnimation)\n\n    def setLODAnimation(self, farDistance, nearDistance, delayFactor):\n        \"\"\" Activates a special mode in which the Actor animates less\n        frequently as it gets further from the camera.  This is\n        intended as a simple optimization to minimize the effort of\n        computing animation for lots of characters that may not\n        necessarily be very important to animate every frame.",
