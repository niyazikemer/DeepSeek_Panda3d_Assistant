  "content": "This chunk of code is part of a method that handles mouse-based operations such as object selection and camera manipulation in a 3D graphics application using Panda3D's DirectGUI framework. The specific code block is responsible for determining the center of attention (COA) when the user is not actively manipulating the camera, by performing ray-picking to detect intersections with objects in the scene. It updates the COA marker's position based on the detected hit point and processes the intersection results to record relevant entries.\n\nThe method appears to be part of a larger class that manages user interactions, including key events for movement, selection, and manipulation of 3D objects. The code ensures that ray-picking is performed only when no objects are selected and under certain mouse conditions, providing feedback through visual markers in the scene.\n\n# Do this when not trying to manipulate camera\n        direct = ShowBaseGlobal.direct\n        if not self.altDown and len(direct.selected.getSelectedAsList()) == 0:\n            # Check for a hit point based on\n            # current mouse position\n            # Allow intersection with unpickable objects\n            # And then spawn task to determine mouse mode\n            # Don't intersect with hidden or backfacing objects\n            skipFlags = DG.SKIP_HIDDEN | DG.SKIP_BACKFACE\n            # Skip camera (and its children), unless control key is pressed\n            skipFlags |= DG.SKIP_CAMERA * (1 - base.getControl())\n            self.computeCOA(direct.iRay.pickGeom(skipFlags = skipFlags))\n            # Record reference point\n            self.coaMarkerRef.setPosHprScale(base.cam, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)\n            # Record entries\n            self.cqEntries = []\n            for i in range(direct.iRay.getNumEntries()):",
