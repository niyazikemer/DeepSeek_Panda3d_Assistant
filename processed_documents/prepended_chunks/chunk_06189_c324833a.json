  "content": "The document provides an introduction to using the PandAI library with Panda3D, focusing on implementing AI behaviors in games. It covers steering behaviors such as seek, flee, pursue, evade, wander, flock, obstacle avoidance, and path following, along with pathfinding techniques that use A* algorithm with Binary Heap optimizations for efficient obstacle avoidance. The document also includes links to additional resources like getting-started guides, detailed sections on steering behaviors and pathfinding, and source codes.\n\nPathfinding using PandAI\n\nPanda3D is currently integrated with the AI library called PandAI v1.0.\n\nPandAI is a simple AI library for Panda3D which provides functionality to create 'Artificially Intelligent' behavior in NPC (Non-Playable Characters) in games.\n\nThe PandAI library provides functionality for:\n\nSteering Behaviors:\n\nSeek, Flee, Pursue, Evade, Wander, Flock, Obstacle Avoidance, Path Following\n\nPath Finding:\n\nThis section is devoted to intelligently avoiding obstacles via the shortest path (calculated via the A* algorithm with Binary Heap optimizations). Its functionality and limitations are explained in more detail in its own section.\n\ngetting-started steering-behaviors/index pathfinding/index source-codes",
