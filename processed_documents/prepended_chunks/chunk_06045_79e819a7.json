  "content": "The provided chunk discusses the structure and attributes of `ObjectType` and `Joint` nodes within the egg file format documentation. This section is situated after explaining general grouping elements and before detailing more specific node types like `Bundle`, `Table`, and animation-related entries. The context focuses on defining how object types are categorized, their predefined sets of attributes, and how joint nodes are used to define skeletal structures for character animations in the egg file format.\n\nValid types so far are:\n\nThe flags may be any zero or more of:\n\nObjectType\n\n<ObjectType>\u00a0{\u00a0type\u00a0}\n\nThis is a short form to indicate one of several pre-canned sets of attributes. Type may be any word, and a Config definition will be searched for by the name \"egg-object-type-word\", where \"word\" is the type word. This definition may contain any arbitrary egg syntax to be parsed in at this group level.\n\nA number of predefined ObjectType definitions are provided:\n\nJoint Nodes\n\n<Joint> name {\n  [transform]\n  [ref-list]\n  [joint-list]\n}\n\nA joint is a highly specialized kind of grouping node. A tree of joints is used to specify the skeletal structure of an animated character.\n\nA joint may only contain one of three things. It may contain a <Transform> entry, as above, which defines the joint's unanimated (rest) position; it may contain lists of assigned vertices or CV's; and it may contain other joints.",
