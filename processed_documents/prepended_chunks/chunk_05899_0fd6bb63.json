  "content": "The chunk discusses how to adjust the horizontal and vertical fields of view independently when setting a lens's field of view using the two-parameter form of `Lens.set_fov()`, emphasizing its impact on the lens's aspect ratio.\n\nThere is actually a separate horizontal field of view and vertical field of view, both of which may be independently controlled with the two-parameter form of ~.Lens.set_fov: lens.set_fov(horizontalAngle, verticalAngle) <.Lens.set_fov>. Using the two-parameter form will change the aspect ratio of the lens (see below). Normally, you would set the field of view using only the one-parameter form, which sets the horizontal field of view directly, and automatically recomputes the vertical field of view to preserve the same aspect ratio.",
