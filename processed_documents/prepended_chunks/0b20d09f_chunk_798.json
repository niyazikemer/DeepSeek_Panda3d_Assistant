  "content": "The chunk appears to be part of a code snippet for creating a user interface element (likely a checkbox) to control the activation state of a physics simulation's force group. The context involves methods like `createLinearForceWidgets`, `createAngularForceWidgets`, and similar functions that generate UI elements for configuring different types of forces. The chunk is used within these methods to create a toggleable option, allowing users to enable or disable specific force groups in the simulation.\n\nlabel = name,\n                variable = forceActive,\n                command = (lambda s = self,\n                           f = force,\n                           v = forceActive: s.toggleForceGroup(f, v)))",
