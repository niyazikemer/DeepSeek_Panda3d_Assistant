  "content": "The chunk provides an overview of the DirectGui system in Panda3D, explaining its purpose, functionality, and integration with NodePath. It situates within a document discussing various graphical interface elements, their creation, customization, and event handling in both Python and C++.\n\nDirectGUI\n\npython\n\nThe DirectGUI Python modules\n\nPanda3D comes with a set of tools for the creation of a graphical interface for any program. The DirectGui system is used to create buttons, labels, text entries, and frames within the program. All of these items can be decorated with text, images, and 3D graphics. Commands may be associated with these items as well. Since these objects inherit from the .NodePath class, anything done to a NodePath may be done to them, such as ~.NodePath.show()/~.NodePath.hide(), ~.NodePath.set_pos(), posInterval(), and so on. Also, since DirectGui objects are by default parented to the node ~builtins.aspect2d, they will stay on the screen no matter how the user navigates through the world.",
