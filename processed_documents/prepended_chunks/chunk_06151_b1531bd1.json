  "content": "The provided document explains how to use Interrogate, a tool for generating bindings between C++ and scripting languages like Python. It covers setting up projects, using macros with `-D`, specifying output paths with `-oc` and `-od`, naming modules and libraries, and other important options.\n\nWhen calling interrogate, you will need to include the -oc and -od options, which specify where the generated code and function tables, respectively, will be written.\n\nThe -module and -library options are used to specify the name of your module and library. These options are mainly code-organizational. You can omit both options.\n\nWith -D you can ignore or make interrogate interpret symbols differently. For example, if your code uses a non-standard C macro like __inline, you would need to call interrogate with -D__inline. Or, if you would like certain defines to be defined differently, you can use -Ddefvar=value.",
