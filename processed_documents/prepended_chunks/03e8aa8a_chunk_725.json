  "content": "The provided chunk defines system-level floaters for a particle system simulation, including parameters like pool size, birth rate, litter size, spread, and lifespan. These settings control high-level behavior of the particle system, such as how many particles can exist simultaneously, how often new particles are created, and how long the system persists. This section appears to be part of a larger codebase that manages particle effects in a 3D graphics library or game development framework, likely using Panda3D given the context. The chunk is situated within the document as part of defining widgets for the \"System Page\" tab, alongside other UI elements controlling emitter and force properties.\n\n## SYSTEM PAGE WIDGETS ##\n        # Create system floaters\n        systemFloaterDefs = (\n            ('System', 'Pool Size',\n             'Max number of simultaneous particles',\n             self.setSystemPoolSize,\n             1.0, 2000000, 1.0),\n            ('System', 'Birth Rate',\n             'Seconds between particle births',\n             self.setSystemBirthRate,\n             0.0, None, None),\n            ('System', 'Litter Size',\n             'Number of particle created at each birth',\n             self.setSystemLitterSize,\n             1.0, 0x7fffffff, 1.0),\n            ('System', 'Litter Spread',\n             'Variation in litter size',\n             self.setSystemLitterSpread,\n             0.0, 0x7fffffff, 1.0),\n            ('System', 'Lifespan',\n             'Age in seconds at which the system (vs. particles) should die',\n             self.setSystemLifespan,\n             0.0, None, None)\n        )\n        self.createFloaters(systemPage, systemFloaterDefs)",
