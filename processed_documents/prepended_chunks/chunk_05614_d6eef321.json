  "content": "The chunk contains the `__doUpdate` method, which is responsible for updating distributed objects (DOs) based on received messages. The method first checks if the DO exists in the `doId2do` dictionary; if found, it delegates the update to the object's dclass. If not found and `ovUpdated` is false, it attempts to find an avatar handle using `identifyAvatar`, forwarding updates to that handle if available. This context situates the chunk within a class managing distributed objects, emphasizing its role in processing updates for DOs or avatars when direct references are unavailable.\n\ndef __doUpdate(self, doId, di, ovUpdated):\n        # Find the DO\n        do = self.doId2do.get(doId)\n        if do is not None:\n            # Let the dclass finish the job\n            do.dclass.receiveUpdate(do, di)\n        elif not ovUpdated:\n            # this next bit is looking for avatar handles so that if you get an update\n            # for an avatar that isn't in your doId2do table but there is a\n            # avatar handle for that object then it's messages will be forwarded to that\n            # object.
