  "content": "The chunk introduces the concept of Cameras and their associated Lens objects, explaining that each Camera has a Lens that defines its viewing properties. It provides an overview of the default camera setup in ShowBase, including references to `base.cam` and `base.camLens`, and mentions that while default settings are suitable for simple applications, developers may need to adjust lens properties like field of view using various interfaces. This section serves as a foundational introduction to understanding how Cameras and Lenses work together before delving into more detailed discussions about specific lens properties.\n\nLenses and Field of View\n\nEvery Camera has a Lens object that defines the properties of its view. For simple applications, you do not need to think about the lens; you will probably be happy with the default lens properties. However, you will occasionally want to adjust some properties of the lens, such as its field of view, and there are several interfaces to do this, depending on how you want to think about the lens.\n\npython\n\nWhen you start ShowBase, a default camera and lens are created for you automatically. The default camera object is stored in base.cam <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.cam> (although by convention, if you want to move the default camera you should manipulate base.camera <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.camera> instead), and the default lens is base.camLens <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.camLens>.",
