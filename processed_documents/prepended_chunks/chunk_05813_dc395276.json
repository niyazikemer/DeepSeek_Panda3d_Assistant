  "content": "The provided text is situated within a comprehensive guide on file format support in Panda3D, detailing how various models and assets can be imported into the framework. The section discusses the integration with the Assimp library as an alternative method for loading unsupported formats without requiring explicit conversion to the Egg format.\n\nFor more information on the glTF format and importing glTF files into Panda3D, see gltf-files.\n\nAssimp Plug-In\n\nPanda3D also provides a plug-in out of the box that integrates with the Assimp library. This third-party library supports a broad range of different formats, such as .obj, .stl and .dxf, allowing them to be loaded into Panda3D without an explicit conversion step.\n\nThe full list of supported formats is available on this page:\n\nhttps://assimp-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/introduction.html\n\nThe quality of support varies substantially from format to format, and it is preferred to use a more specific plug-in if one is available for that format. For example, Assimp includes support for .gltf files, but the panda3d-gltf plug-in (mentioned above) is considered to be higher-quality.",
