  "content": "The `createObjectId` method in the `AsyncRequest` class is used to asynchronously generate a new database object's identifier (doId) without locally instantiating the object. This method is part of a system designed for managing asynchronous operations, allowing applications to efficiently handle distributed objects by requesting only their IDs when necessary.\n\n**Context:**\nThe `createObjectId` method within the `AsyncRequest` class facilitates the creation of new database objects and retrieval of their doId asynchronously, useful in scenarios where object ID is needed without local instantiation.\n\ndef createObjectId(self, name, className, values = None, context = None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Create a new database object.  You can get the doId from within\n        your self.finish() function.",
