  "content": "The chunk discusses Panda3D configuration settings related to model loading efficiency, animation channel compression, and collision handling, with a focus on optimizing performance and managing how models and animations are processed at runtime.\n\nper-frame overhead to count these things up. ptloader-load-node bool 1 Specify true to allow libptloader to invoke the more efficient but\npossibly-experimental code to load model files directly into PandaNode\nwhen possible. Specify false to force the loading to always go through\nthe egg library, which is more likely to be reliable. ptloader-units enum invalid Specifies the preferred units into which models will be converted\nwhen using libptloader to automatically convert files to Panda at load\ntime, via e.g. \"pview myMayaFile.mb\". pushers-horizontal bool 0 Set this true to make all CollisionHandlerPushers have the\nset_horizontal() flag by default, false to let the move in three\ndimensions by default. read-compressed-channels bool 1 Set this false to disable reading of compressed animation channels,\neven if the decompression code is available. The only reason you might\nwant to do this would be to speed load time when you don't care about",
