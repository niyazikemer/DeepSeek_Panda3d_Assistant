  "content": "This chunk situates within the document's explanation of Panda3D's Interval system, specifically addressing how to manage and execute intervals globally across both Python and C++ implementations. It provides essential instructions for importing necessary modules and managing interval playback, crucial for developers working with either language in Panda3D.\n\nfrom direct.interval.IntervalManager import ivalMgr\n\ncpp\n\nThe class responsible for keeping track of the intervals that are currently playing and updating them periodically is called .CIntervalManager. There is one global instance, available via .CIntervalManager::get_global_ptr(). You need to call ~.CIntervalManager::step() on this class every frame in order to advance the intervals.\n\nUsing Intervals\n\npython\n\nIn any Panda3D module that uses Intervals, you should first import the interval module:\n\nfrom direct.interval.IntervalGlobal import *\n\nThere are a handful of methods that all Intervals have in common.\n\nTo start an Interval playing, use one of the following:\n\ninterval.start()\ninterval.start(startT, endT, playRate)\ninterval.loop()\ninterval.loop(startT, endT, playRate)",
