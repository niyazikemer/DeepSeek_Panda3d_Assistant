  "content": "This chunk provides an overview of the three text interfaces available in Panda3D for rendering dynamic text onscreen or within a 3-D world. It also discusses how to render 3D models in a 2D scene graph while addressing depth buffer considerations.\n\npython\n\nThere are three interfaces for creating text, depending on your requirements: the TextNode <text-node>, which is the fundamental text-rendering class and serves as the implementation for the other two, onscreentext, a simple high-level wrapper around TextNode, and directlabel, which integrates with the rest of the directgui system.\n\nRendering 3D Models\n\nIt is possible to render 3D models in the 2D scene graph. However, because the depth buffer is disabled by default on the 2D scene graph, self-overlapping models may not render correctly. It is necessary to turn on the depth buffer for these models. This is explained on the page depth-test-and-depth-write.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nrendering-text rendering-images directgui/index text-fonts embedded-text-properties",
