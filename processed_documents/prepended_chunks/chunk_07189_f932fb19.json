  "content": "This section introduces the concept of Task Chains in Panda, explaining that tasks are added to a default chain but can be assigned to custom chains if needed. It highlights the purpose of creating additional task chains for threaded tasks, allowing parallel execution or lower priority processing relative to main tasks. The document then continues by detailing how to set up and configure task chains, including parameters like threading options, and discusses adding tasks to specific chains as well as considerations for thread safety in Panda applications.\n\nTask Chains\n\nWhen you add tasks to the TaskManager, you are actually adding them to the default Task Chain. The TaskManager maintains one or more task chains; each chain is a list of tasks that are available to be executed.\n\nYou are free to create additional task chains as you see the need. Normally, though, there is no reason to have more than the default task chain, unless you wish to take advantage of threaded tasks: each task chain has the option of being serviced by one or more sub-threads, which allows the tasks on that chain to run in parallel with (or at a lower priority than) the main tasks.",
