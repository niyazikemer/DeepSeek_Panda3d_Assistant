  "content": "This chunk is a docstring introducing the `BufferViewer` class, explaining its purpose as a debugging tool for render-to-texture effects in computer graphics, providing usage examples (via `base.bufferViewer.toggleEnable()` or Config.prc), and listing the module's public exports. It appears at the top of a Python file containing the BufferViewer implementation.\n\nContext: This chunk introduces the main `BufferViewer` class, which is used for debugging render-to-texture effects by displaying various render targets on screen, as seen in the full document where it implements card layout and frame management for visualizing buffers.\n\n\"\"\"Contains the BufferViewer class, which is used as a debugging aid\nwhen debugging render-to-texture effects.  It shows different views at\nthe bottom of the screen showing the various render targets.\n\nWhen using ShowBase, the normal way to enable the BufferViewer is using the\nfollowing code::\n\n    base.bufferViewer.toggleEnable()\n\nOr, you can enable the following variable in your Config.prc::\n\n    show-buffers true\n\"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ['BufferViewer']",
