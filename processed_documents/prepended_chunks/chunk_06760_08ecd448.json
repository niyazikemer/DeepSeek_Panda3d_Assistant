This will tend to balance out the\nframe rate so that it is more uniformly slow. The default is to compute\nvertices only when they need to be computed, which can lead to an uneven\nframe rate. exclude-texture-scale list This is a list of glob patterns for texture filenames (excluding the\ndirectory part of the filename, but including the extension); for\ninstance, 'digits_*.png'. Any texture filenames that match one of these\npatterns will not be affected by max-texture-dimension or\ntexture-scale. extended-exceptions bool 0 extractor-step-time double 0.005 Specifies the maximum amount of time that should be consumed by a",
