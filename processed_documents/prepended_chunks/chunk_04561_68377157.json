  "content": "This code chunk is part of a system designed to dynamically rebind class methods in a software application. The functions `replaceCRFunc` and `replaceAIRFunc` specifically handle method replacement within distributed object systems, checking for fake instances like Gyedo's fake `cr` to prevent crashes during rebinding. These functions are used to update or modify behavior of runtime components without restarting the application, ensuring compatibility with existing systems such as `base.cr` and `simbase.air`.\n\ndef replaceCRFunc(replaceFuncList):\n    try:\n        base.cr\n    except Exception:\n        return\n    # masad: Gyedo's fake cr causes a crash in followingreplaceMethod on rebinding, so\n    # I throw in the isFake check.
