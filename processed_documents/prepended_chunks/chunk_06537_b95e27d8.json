  "content": "The chunk discusses options for configuring the audio system in Panda3D, including setting the audio library via Config.prc, additional notes on managing default libraries, and related topics such as loading sounds, effects, and multi-channel audio.\n\nIf these choices are not enough for you, then you can try other sound libraries.\n\nSetting the Sound System\n\nTo configure Panda3D to use a specific sound system, you will need to change your Config.prc <configuring-panda3d> configuration. You should look up the variable audio-library-name and change the value to one of p3openal_audio, p3fmod_audio, or miles_audio. (The names of the libraries may differ with the way Panda3D was built.)\n\nExtra Notes\n\nIf you don't want to use one or both of the libraries shipped by default with the SDK, then you can remove the associated library files after installation or compile Panda3D from source with the appropriate settings to keep them out of the build.\n\nloading-playing-sounds-music manipulating-sounds audio-managers dsp-effects 3d-audio multi-channel",
