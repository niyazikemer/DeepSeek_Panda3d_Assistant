  "content": "This chunk is part of a larger document detailing configuration variables in Panda3D, focusing on model caching directories, paths, and movie textures synchronization. The context discusses settings that determine how models are cached and rendered efficiently, as well as how multi-page MovieTextures are handled to ensure visual consistency.\n\norder to perform an occlusion query for it. Nodes and Geoms smaller than\nthis will be rendered directly, without bothering with an occlusion\nquery. model-cache-dir undefined $HOME/.panda3d/cache (from Config.prc); hardcoded model-cache-textures undefined #f (from Config.prc); hardcoded model-path undefined $MAIN_DIR (from Config.prc); $THIS_PRC_DIR/.. (from Config.prc);\n$THIS_PRC_DIR/../models (from Config.prc); hardcoded movies-sync-pages bool 1 Set this true to force multi-page MovieTextures to hold pages back\nif necessary until all pages are ready to render at once, so that the\nmultiple pages of a single movie are always in sync with each other. Set\nthis false to allow individual pages to be visible as soon as they come\navailable, which means pages might sometimes be out of sync. This only\naffects multi-page MovieTextures such as cube maps, 3-d textures, or\nstereo textures, or textures with separate color and alpha channel movie",
