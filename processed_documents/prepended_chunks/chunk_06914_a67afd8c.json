  "content": "The chunk describes the behavior of lighting effects (nondirectional and directional) when no explicit material is applied to an object in Panda3D. It contrasts this default behavior with the customized behavior that occurs when an explicit material is set on an object, including how ambient, diffuse, specular, and emissive properties influence the final rendering. This section explains how materials affect the appearance of objects under different lighting conditions.\n\nContext: **Material Effects on Lighting**\n\nAll nondirectional light is reflected after being modulated by the model's color.\n\nAll directional light is scattered after being modulated by the model's color.\n\nNo specular reflection occurs.\n\nNo emissivity occurs.\n\nWhen you set an explicit material on an object, the behavior is as follows:\n\nAll nondirectional light is reflected after being modulated by the explicit ambient color.\n\nAll directional light is scattered after being modulated by the explicit diffuse color.\n\nAll directional light is reflected specularly after being modulated by the explicit specular color.\n\nThe explicit emissive color is added to the light.\n\nIt is possible to mix-and-match explicit with default behavior. For example, you can specify an explicit specular color, but not specify an explicit ambient, diffuse, or emissive color. If you do that, the behavior would be:\n\nAll nondirectional light is reflected after being modulated by the model's color.",
