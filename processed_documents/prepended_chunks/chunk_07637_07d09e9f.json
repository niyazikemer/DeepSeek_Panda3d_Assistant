  "content": "The paragraph discusses the use of parasite buffers by `~.GraphicsOutput.make_texture_buffer()` as an alternative when GraphicsBuffers are unavailable, addressing potential limitations such as garbling the main window or texture size mismatches.\n\nfrom scratch every frame anyway. The other problem with this trick is that it fails if the main window is smaller than the desired texture. Since neither of these problems is common in practice, ~.GraphicsOutput.make_texture_buffer() will use parasite buffers transparently if GraphicsBuffers are not available.",
