  "content": "The document explains how PStats collects, transmits, and analyzes performance data from clients to servers for visualization. The chunk focuses on Time-based Strip Charts as a server-generated visual tool that breaks down frame-by-frame performance metrics into key stages (App, Cull, Draw) with a residual \"Frame\" category for unaccounted time.\n\n**Succinct Context:**\nThe chunk describes how PStats' server uses Time-based Strip Charts to visually represent frame performance metrics, breaking each frame into App, Cull, Draw stages and any residual time.\n\nTime-based Strip Charts\n\nThis is the graph type you will use most frequently to examine performance data. The horizontal axis represents the passage of time; each frame is represented as a vertical slice on the graph. The overall height of the colored bands represents the total amount of time spent on each frame; within the frame, the time is further divided into the primary subdivisions represented by different color bands (and labeled on the left). These subdivisions are called \"collectors\" in the PStats terminology, since they represent time collected by different tasks.\n\nNormally, the three primary collectors are App, Cull, and Draw, the three stages of the graphics pipeline. Atop these three colored collectors is the label \"Frame\", which represents any remaining time spent in the frame that was not specifically allocated to one of the three child collectors (normally, there should not be significant time reported here).",
