  "content": "This chunk provides a step-by-step guide for modifying Python and C++ code to implement intervals and sequences in order to animate a panda's movement back and forth between two points, utilizing Panda3D's animation system. It explains how to create and combine positional and rotational intervals into a sequence that produces a continuous pacing animation, demonstrating practical application of the concepts introduced earlier about intervals and sequences.\n\nThe next step is to cause the panda to actually move back and forth. Update the code to the following:\n\npython\n\nusing-intervals-to-move-the-panda.py\n\ncpp\n\nusing-intervals-to-move-the-panda.cxx\n\nWhen the pandaPosInterval1 interval is started, it will gradually adjust the position of the panda from (0, 10, 0) to (0, -10, 0) over a period of 13 seconds. Similarly, when the pandaHprInterval1 interval is started, the heading of the panda will rotate 180 degrees over a period of 3 seconds.\n\nThe pandaPace sequence above causes the panda to move in a straight line, turn, move in the opposite straight line, and finally turn again. The code pandaPace.loop() causes the Sequence to be started in looping mode.\n\nRun the Program\n\nThe result of all this is to cause the panda to pace back and forth from one tree to the other.",
