  "content": "The provided chunk serves as the introduction to the Stereo Display Regions section in the document, offering an overview of their purpose and creation methods before delving into specific details such as configuration options and technical aspects.\n\nStereo Display Regions\n\nA .StereoDisplayRegion is a special kind of DisplayRegion that contains two views internally: one view for the left eye, and a different view for the right eye. If you have a special 3-D display device, then Panda can use it to deliver each view to the appropriate eye.\n\nAlternatively, you can also simply create the two required views independently, one DisplayRegion for the left eye, and a separate DisplayRegion for the right eye. However, creating a single StereoDisplayRegion for both eyes at the same time is often more convenient.\n\nWhen you call window.make_display_region() <.GraphicsOutput.make_display_region>, it will implicitly return a StereoDisplayRegion instead of a regular DisplayRegion if your window or buffer indicates that it supports stereo output (that is, if window.isStereo() returns true). There are four ways that you can have a graphics output that supports stereo output:",
