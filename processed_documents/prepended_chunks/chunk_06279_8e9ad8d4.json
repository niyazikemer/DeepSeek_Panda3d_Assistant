  "content": "The chunk provides an overview of the Panda3D Egg file format's supported features and limitations. It highlights elements such as vertices, joints, and animation keyframes while noting absent components like light sources and shaders. Additionally, it explains texture path handling and mentions that animations are often stored separately but can be integrated. This section is part of a comprehensive guide on the Egg format within Panda3D's documentation.\n\nThe Egg format supports, among other things:\n\nVertices\n\nTriangles and larger polygons\n\nJoints (aka Bones)\n\nVertex weights\n\nTexture pathnames (textures are not stored)\n\nBone-based animation keyframes\n\nMorph targets (aka Blend targets)\n\nMorph animation keyframes\n\nMany control flags\n\nNotably, these things are not represented:\n\nLight sources\n\nShaders\n\nThe paths (e.g. for textures) can be either relative (as seen from the Egg file) or absolute (full path). See filename-syntax for more info about Panda's Filename Syntax. In most cases the relative path makes more sense.\n\nAnimations",
