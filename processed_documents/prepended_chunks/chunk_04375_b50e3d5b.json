  "content": "The chunk explains how `loadModel()` operates when a `callback` is provided, detailing asynchronous model loading behavior, return value, and callback invocation within the `Loader` class documentation.\n\nIf callback is not None, then the model load will be performed\n        asynchronously.  In this case, loadModel() will initiate a\n        background load and return immediately.  The return value will\n        be an object that can be used to check the status, cancel the\n        request, or use it in an `await` expression.  Unless callback\n        is the special value True, when the requested model(s) have\n        finished loading, it will be invoked with the n\n        loaded models passed as its parameter list.  It is possible\n        that the callback will be invoked immediately, even before\n        loadModel() returns.  If you use callback, you may also\n        specify a priority, which specifies the relative importance\n        over this model over all of the other asynchronous load\n        requests (higher numbers are loaded first).",
