  "content": "The provided chunk is part of the `FourState` class's docstring, which introduces this mix-in class designed for distributed objects. This class serves as a base for managing state transitions in systems requiring opposing states and their intermediate transitions, such as a door system with closed, open, opening, closing, and off states. The chunk explains its purpose and structure within the broader context of state management in distributed environments.\n\nclass FourState:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generic four state ClassicFSM base class.\n\n    This is a mix-in class that expects that your derived class\n    is a DistributedObject.\n\n    Inherit from FourStateFSM and pass in your states.  Two of\n    the states should be oposites of each other and the other\n    two should be the transition states between the first two.\n    E.g::\n\n                    +--------+\n                 -->| closed | --\n                |   +--------+   |\n                |                |\n                |                v\n          +---------+       +---------+\n          | closing |<----->| opening |\n          +---------+       +---------+\n                ^                |\n                |                |\n                |    +------+    |\n                 ----| open |<---\n                     +------+\n\n    There is a fifth off state, but that is an implementation\n    detail (and that's why it's not called a five state ClassicFSM).",
