  "content": "The provided chunk is a section within a detailed document outlining various predefined uniform inputs available in GLSL shaders. These uniforms include information about active clip planes, frame timing data (current time, delta time, and frame count), hardware skinning transformations for joints, and parameters for each non-ambient light source such as color, position, and attenuation settings. This section is part of a larger list describing the extensive set of predefined uniform inputs that can be utilized in shaders to control rendering behavior, including aspects like clipping, animation timing, character deformation via skinning, and lighting effects.\n\n// Active clip planes, in apiview space.  If there is no clip plane for a given\n// index, it is guaranteed to contain vec4(0, 0, 0, 0).\nuniform vec4 p3d_ClipPlane[...];\n\n// Reports the frame time of the current frame, for animations.\nuniform float osg_FrameTime;\n// The time elapsed since the previous frame.\nuniform float osg_DeltaFrameTime;\n// New in 1.10.0. Contains the number of frames elapsed since program start.\nuniform int osg_FrameNumber;\n\n// If hardware skinning is enabled, this contains the transform of each joint.\n// Superfluous array entries will contain the identity matrix.\nuniform mat4 p3d_TransformTable[...];\n\n// New in 1.10.  Contains information for each non-ambient light.\n// May also be used to access a light passed as a shader input.\nuniform struct p3d_LightSourceParameters {\n  // Primary light color.\n  vec4 color;",
