  "content": "The document discusses optimizing polygon usage to improve rendering performance in Panda3D. After identifying potential causes of performance issues related to polygon counts, it offers solutions such as reducing geometric complexity, employing level-of-detail (LOD) techniques, using normal mapping, and enabling hardware skinning for vertex animations.\n\nYou can have multiple levels of detail <level-of-detail> for your mesh.\n\nIf you have a high-poly model, you can create a low-poly version of it and generate a normal map from the high-poly model which you can assign to your low-poly version in Panda. Normal mapping requires lightning and the ShaderGenerator or a custom shader.\n\nSometimes it's possible to represent a mesh as a textured plane billboard <billboard-effects>. This can be combined with LOD <level-of-detail> by using a billboard for the lowest levels of detail.\n\nIf a lot of time is taken up by vertex animation, then you may obtain some benefit from enabling hardware skinning, which causes the vertex transformation to be performed on the GPU instead of the CPU. To enable this, set the following variables in your Config.prc <configuring-panda3d>:\n\nhardware-animated-vertices true\nbasic-shaders-only false",
