  "content": "The chunk introduces Light Ramps in graphics programming, discussing standard OpenGL/DirectX lighting calculations that include two clamping steps. It explains how `.LightRampAttrib` can replace these clamps for advanced effects like HDR tone mapping and cartoon shading, noting the requirement for per-pixel lighting via the shader generator. This section serves as an overview before diving into specific implementations of HDR and quantized lighting techniques.\n\nLight Ramps\n\nIn standard OpenGL and DirectX lighting, the following calculations are performed:\n\nthe lighting value is calculated\n\nit is clamped to the range 0-1\n\nit is combined with the textures\n\nit is clamped to the range 0-1 again\n\nit is written to the frame buffer\n\nThis process contains two clamps. The .LightRampAttrib is a means to specify that you wish to replace these two clamping operators with something a little smarter. This is particularly relevant for two major graphics algorithms: HDR tone mapping, and cartoon shading.\n\nIt must be emphasized that light ramps have no effect unless per-pixel lighting is enabled via the shader generator <the-shader-generator>.\n\nHDR Tone Mapping\n\nNote\n\nFor a more advanced way to apply High Dynamic Range rendering, see the HDR postprocessing filter described in common-image-filters.",
