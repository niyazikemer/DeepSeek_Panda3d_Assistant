  "content": "This chunk discusses an optimization technique related to rendering order, specifically focusing on how certain graphics hardware benefits from front-to-back ordering to improve performance through effective use of the Z-buffer algorithm.\n\nSecondly, some hardware has a different optimization requirement, and may benefit from drawing nearer things before farther things, so that the Z-buffer algorithm can effectively short-circuit some of the advanced shading features in the graphics card for pixels that would be obscured anyway. This sort of hardware will draw things fastest when the scene is sorted in order from the nearest object to the farthest object, or \"front-to-back\" ordering.",
