  "content": "The chunk discusses advanced control options for `GeoMipTerrain`, including setting a minimum LOD level to optimize performance by reducing high-quality rendering near the focal point and enabling automatic flattening to manage meshes efficiently, ensuring smooth updates without interfering with the terrain regeneration process.\n\npython\n\nterrain.setMinLevel(2)\n\ncpp\n\nterrain.set_min_level(2);\n\nIf you make the value higher, it will decrease the quality level near the focal point.\n\nAutomatic Flattening\n\nSince flattening the terrain root might interfere with the updating system, GeoMipTerrain provides an auto-flattening function, which can be really useful if you have too many meshes <too-many-meshes> in your scene. This function calls one of NodePath's flattening functions every time the terrain is regenerated, and each time before the chunks are modified the terrain is restored from a backup node:\n\npython\n\nterrain.setAutoFlatten(GeoMipTerrain.AFMStrong)\n\ncpp\n\nterrain.set_auto_flatten(GeoMipTerrain::AFM_strong);",
