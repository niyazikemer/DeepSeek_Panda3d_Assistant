(Normally, textures get a simple image at\negg2bam time.) This slows the initial loading time of textures, but\nallows you to take advantage of gsg::set_incomplete_render() to load\ntextures on-the-fly in a sub-thread. It's not generally necessary if you\nare loading bam files that were generated via egg2bam. preload-textures bool 1 When this is true, texture images are loaded from disk as soon as\nthe Texture is created from the TexturePool. When this is false, the\nTexture is created immediately, but the image data is not loaded from\ndisk until the Texture is actually rendered (or otherwise prepared) on",
