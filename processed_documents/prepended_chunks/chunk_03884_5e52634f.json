  "content": "This chunk describes the parameters and return value of a method related to adding tasks within a TaskManager class. It explains the purpose of the \"taskChain\" parameter, which assigns the task to a specific named chain; the optional \"owner\" parameter for object ownership and maintenance methods; and the \"delay\" parameter for scheduling when the task should begin. The return value is either a new Task object or an existing one if provided.\n\ntaskChain (str): the name of the task chain to assign the\n                task to.\n\n            owner: an optional Python object that is declared as the\n                \"owner\" of this task for maintenance purposes.  The\n                owner must have two methods:\n                ``owner._addTask(self, task)``, which is called when the\n                task begins, and ``owner._clearTask(self, task)``, which\n                is called when the task terminates.  This is all the\n                ownermeans.\n\n            delay: an optional amount of seconds to wait before starting\n                the task (equivalent to doMethodLater).\n\n        Returns:\n            The new Task object that has been added, or the original\n            Task object that was passed in.\n        \"\"\"",
