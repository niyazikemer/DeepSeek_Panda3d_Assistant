  "content": "The chunk is part of the `EventManager` class's event processing workflow, specifically within the `processEvent` and `processEventPstats` methods. It handles logging received events (excluding 'NewFrame' for noise reduction), sending events to Python listeners via `messenger.send`, and dispatching them to C++ handlers if applicable. This code ensures consistent event handling across both standard and performance-profiled processing paths in the `EventManager`.\n\n# Do not print the new frame debug, it is too noisy!\n            if EventManager.notify.getDebug() and eventName != 'NewFrame':\n                EventManager.notify.debug('received C++ event named: ' + eventName +\n                                          ' parameters: ' + repr(paramList))\n            # **************************************************************\n            # ******** Duplicate any changes in processEventPstats *********\n            # **************************************************************\n            # Send the event, we used to send it with the event\n            # name as a parameter, but now you can use extraArgs for that\n            messenger.send(eventName, paramList)\n\n            # Also send the event down into C++ land\n            handler = self.eventHandler\n            if handler:\n                handler.dispatchEvent(event)",
