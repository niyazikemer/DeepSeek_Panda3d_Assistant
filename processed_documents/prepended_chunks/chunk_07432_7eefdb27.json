  "content": "The document describes how to implement positional audio using Panda3D's `Audio3DManager`. The chunk introduces two methods: `setDistanceFactor(scale)` for adjusting the scale factor of distance units, and `setDropOffFactor(scale)` for controlling the rate at which sound volume decreases with distance. These settings allow customization of sound attenuation behavior, including options to disable distance-based volume changes by setting the drop-off factor to zero.\n\naudio3d.setDistanceFactor(scale)\n\nYou can adjust the rate that sounds attenuate by distance. If you want to position the sounds but don't want the volume to be effected by their distance, you can set the drop off factor to 0.\n\naudio3d.setDropOffFactor(scale)",
