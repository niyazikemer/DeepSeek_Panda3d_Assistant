  "content": "The chunk explains how a `createDistributedObject` method initializes and registers a new distributed object either by class name or instance. It should be placed near the top of the document, before methods that manage existing objects like sending updates or deletions, to introduce object creation early in the workflow.\n\n</context>\n\n\"\"\" To create a DistributedObject, you must pass in either the\n        name of the object's class, or an already-created instance of\n        the class (or both).  If you pass in just a class name (to the\n        className parameter), then a default instance of the object\n        will be created, with whatever parameters the default\n        constructor supplies.  Alternatively, if you wish to create\n        some initial values different from the default, you can create\n        the instance yourself and supply it to the distObj parameter,\n        then that instance will be used instead.  (It should be a\n        newly-created object, not one that has already been manifested\n        on the network or previously passed through\n        createDistributedObject.)  In either case, the new\n        DistributedObject is returned from this method.\n\n        This method will issue the appropriate network commands to\n        make this object appear on all of the other clients.",
