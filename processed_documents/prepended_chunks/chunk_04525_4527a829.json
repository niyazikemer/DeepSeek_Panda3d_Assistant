  "content": "The `finished()` method is part of a class used within the provided code document to handle completion notifications for asynchronous operations. Specifically, this method is called when an operation completes and triggers any defined done callback function. This functionality is essential for managing asynchronous task flow and ensuring proper cleanup or follow-up actions after task completion.\n\nContext:  \nThe `finished()` method belongs to a job or task class (e.g., `FindContainers`, `CheckContainers`, or similar) that handles asynchronous operations within the document. It ensures any registered callback is executed upon task completion, facilitating proper resource management and workflow continuation.\n\ndef finished(self):\n        if self._doneCallback:\n            self._doneCallback(self)",
