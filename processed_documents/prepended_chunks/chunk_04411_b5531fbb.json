  "content": "The chunk is part of the documentation and code for a method within a Loader class, specifically explaining and implementing functionality related to loading 3D textures with multiview or stereo support.\n\n```text\nContext: The code snippet explains and implements functionality for loading multi-view or stereo textures in the load_3d_texture method. It specifies how images are divided into views when multiview is enabled.\n```\n\nIf multiview is true, it indicates to load a multiview or\n        stereo texture.  In this case, numViews should also be\n        specified (the default is 2), and the sequence of texture\n        images will be divided into numViews views.  The total\n        z-height will be (numImages / numViews).  For instance, if you\n        read 16 images with numViews = 2, then you have created a\n        stereo multiview image, with z = 8.  In this example, images\n        numbered 0 - 7 will be part of the left eye view, and images\n        numbered 8 - 15 will be part of the right eye view.\n        \"\"\"\n        assert Loader.notify.debug(\"Loading 3-D texture: %s\" % (texturePattern))\n        if loaderOptions is None:\n            loaderOptions = LoaderOptions()\n        else:\n            loaderOptions = LoaderOptions(loaderOptions)\n        if multiview is not None:\n            flags = loaderOptions.getTextureFlags()\n            if multiview:\n                flags |= LoaderOptions.TFMultiview",
