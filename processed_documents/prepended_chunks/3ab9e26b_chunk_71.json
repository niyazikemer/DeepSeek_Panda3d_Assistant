It handles the transformation of each line of input, dealing with different comment styles, and preparing them for use in generating API documentation. This function would be called during the documentation build process, likely integrated with other autodoc processors to ensure that C++ style comments are correctly interpreted and rendered by Sphinx.\n\nThe context is as follows: \n\n**Context:**  \nThe `convert_oxigen_docstring` function is a utility designed to convert Doxygen-style C++ block comments into a format compatible with Sphinx. It processes each line of input, handling different comment styles and preparing the documentation for use in generating API reference materials. This function would be integrated into the documentation build process, ensuring that code comments written in a C++ style are accurately transformed into the expected format for inclusion in the generated documentation.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe `convert_oxigen_docstring` function is situated within the overall document as a utility to convert Doxygen-style C++ block comments into Sphinx-compatible docstrings.
