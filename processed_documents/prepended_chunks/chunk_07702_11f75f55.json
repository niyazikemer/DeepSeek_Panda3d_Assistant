  "content": "The document provides comprehensive instructions on compiling Panda3D programs using various tools, including Microsoft Visual Studio, GCC/G++, and considerations for macOS. The chunk focuses on setting up a project in Visual Studio 2015 (and later versions), guiding users through creating a Win32 Console application, adjusting build configurations to match the Panda3D SDK settings, and ensuring compatibility between the project's architecture and the SDK's build type.\n\nCompiling your Program with Visual Studio\n\nThe descriptions below assume Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, but they should also work for 2017, 2019 and 2022.\n\nSetting up the project\n\nWhen creating a new project in Visual Studio, be sure to select the template for a \"Win32 Console application\" under the Visual C++ templates category. We recommend disabling \"Precompiled headers\" for now. (Don't worry, you can still change these things later.)\n\nWhen you created your project, the first thing you'll need to do is change \"Debug\" to \"Release\" below the menu bar, as shown in the image below. This is because the SDK builds of Panda3D are compiled in Release mode as well. The program will crash mysteriously if the setting doesn't match up with the setting that was used to compile Panda3D. This goes for the adjacent platform selector as well; select \"x64\" if you use the 64-bit Panda3D SDK, and \"x86\" if you use the 32-bit version.",
