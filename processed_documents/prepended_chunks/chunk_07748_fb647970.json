  "content": "The chunk discusses the use of YABEE for exporting models from older versions of Blender to Egg format, provides a caution about community-made ports of YABEE, and explains the COLLADA format's role in model conversion using dae2egg, while noting its potential obsolescence.\n\nhttps://github.com/09th/YABEE\n\nFor newer versions of Blender (2.8 and up), it is recommended to export via the glTF format instead, see converting-from-blender for more information.\n\nCaution\n\nThere are some community-made ports of YABEE for newer versions of Blender floating around the internet. These ports are not officially supported as they are often tailored to the author's own purposes and may not produce the expected output in the general case.\n\nCOLLADA (.dae)\n\nCOLLADA is a standardized interchange file format that can be exported by many different authoring tools. These files have the .dae or .zae extension.\n\nPanda3D ships a tool called dae2egg that can be used to convert these models to the Egg format. However, it is based on the FCollada library, which has been discontinued, so it is possible that this tool will be removed from a future version of Panda3D. There are currently no plans to rewrite this tool, as the games industry has moved on to prefer the newer glTF format.",
