  "content": "To apply a texture to a model in Panda3D using C++, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Load the Texture**: Use `TexturePool::load_texture()` to load your image file into memory.\n\n2. **Error Check**: Ensure the texture loaded successfully by checking against `None`.\n\n3. **Load the Model**: Use `window->load_model()` to import your 3D model from a file like \"smiley.egg\".\n\n4. **Apply the Texture**: Use the `set_texture()` method on the NodePath of your model, passing the loaded texture and an optional stage number.\n\nThis process allows you to enhance models with detailed textures efficiently in C++.\n\n```cpp\nPT(Texture) tex = TexturePool::load_texture(\"myTexture.png\");\nif (!tex) {\n    // Handle error: texture not found or failed to load\n}\n\nNodePath smiley = window->load_model(\"smiley.egg\");\nsmiley.set_texture(tex, 1);\n```\n\n**Note:** The second argument in `set_texture()` specifies the texture stage; using 1 is common for basic applications.\n\nPT(Texture) tex;\ntex = TexturePool::load_texture(\"myTexture.png\");\n\nNodePath smiley;\nsmiley = window->load_model(window->get_render(), \"smiley.egg\");\nsmiley.set_texture(tex, 1);\n\nThe above TexturePool::load_texture() call will search along the current model-path for the named image file (in this example, a file named \"myTexture.png\"). If the texture is not found or cannot be read for some reason, None is returned.\n\nNote that the Texture class is reference counted <reference-counting>, so it is necessary to use a smart PT(Texture) pointer to ensure that it is not automatically deleted by the garbage collector.\n\nOnce you have a texture, you can apply it to a model with the ~.NodePath.set_texture() call. For instance, suppose you used the .CardMaker class to generate a plain white card:\n\npython\n\ncm = CardMaker('card')\ncard = render.attachNewNode(cm.generate())\n\ncpp\n\nCardMaker cm(\"card\");\nNodePath card = render.attach_new_node(cm.generate());",
