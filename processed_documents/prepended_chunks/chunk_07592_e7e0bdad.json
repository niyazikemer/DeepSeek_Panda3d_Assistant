  "content": "The document explains how to use normal mapping in Panda3D to create lifelike textured surfaces without writing shaders. The chunk provides step-by-step instructions for viewing normal mapping effects using `pview abstractroom.egg`, enabling lighting and per-pixel rendering, while also introducing the limitations of shader synthesis and the need for custom shader programming for more complex requirements.\n\npview abstractroom.egg\n\nAfter pview loads, press 'c' to center the model, 'l' to turn on lighting, and 'p' to turn on per-pixel lighting. Presto, you will see the effects of normal mapping.\n\nIf you are doing this in a program, the steps are basically the same: load a model which already has normal maps, set up some lights, and turn on per-pixel lighting. The sample program Tut-Normal-Mapping-Basic shows this process.\n\nDoing it the Hard Way\n\nThe problem with panda's shader synthesis capabilities is that they can only synthesize the shaders that people usually need. If what you need is esoteric, you'll have to write your own shader.",
