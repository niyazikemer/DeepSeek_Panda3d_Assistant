  "content": "The chunk provides a code example and explanation of how to blend two animations on an actor in Panda3D by setting their respective control effects, enabling the blend mode, starting both animations, and stopping specific animations as needed.\n\npython\n\nactor.enableBlend()\nactor.setControlEffect('animation1', 0.2)\nactor.setControlEffect('animation2', 0.8)\nactor.loop('animation1')\nactor.loop('animation2')\n\nThe above specifies that 20% of animation1 and 80% of animation2 will be visible on the character at the same time. Note that you still have to start both animations playing (and they can be playing from different frames or at different play rates). Starting or stopping an animation in blend mode does not change its control effect; you must set an animation's control effect to 0.0 if you don't want it to affect the actor anymore.\n\nWhen you call ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.stop() in blend mode, you can stop a particular animation by name, if you want; or you can stop all of the animations by calling ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.stop() with no parameters:\n\npython\n\nactor.stop('animation1')",
