  "content": "The chunk is an introductory section of a document detailing methods for navigating and manipulating nodes within a 3D scene graph using NodePath objects in both Python and C++. The section specifically introduces the `~.NodePath.ls()` command, which lists all children of a given NodePath along with their attributes, serving as a foundational tool for debugging and verifying node structures.\n\nSearching the Scene Graph\n\nIt is often useful to get a handle to a particular node deep within the scene graph, especially to get a sub-part of a model that was loaded from a single file. There are a number of methods dedicated to finding entrenched nodes and returning the NodePaths.\n\nFirst, and most useful, is the ~.NodePath.ls() command:\n\npython\n\nmyNodePath.ls()\n\ncpp\n\nmyNodePath.ls();\n\nThis simply lists all of the children of the indicated NodePath, along with all of their children, and so on until the entire subgraph is printed out. It also lists the transforms and render-attributes that are on each node. This is an especially useful command for when you're running interactively with Python; it's a good way to check that the scene graph is what you think it should be.",
