This particular chunk introduces a deprecated boolean variable related to graphics rendering preferences, advising users to use an alternative enum instead.\n\nContext: Deprecated configuration option for graphics buffers\n\nThis variable is deprecated and should not be used. Use the enum\nvariable fmod-speaker-mode instead. force-parasite-buffer bool 0 Set this true to make GraphicsOutput::make_texture_buffer() really\nstrongly prefer ParasiteBuffers over conventional offscreen buffers.\nWith this set, it will create a ParasiteBuffer every time an offscreen\nbuffer is requested, even if this means reducing the buffer size to fit\nwithin the window. The only exceptions are for buffers that, by their\nnature, really cannot use ParasiteBuffers (like depth textures). You\nmight set this true if you don't trust your graphics driver's support",
