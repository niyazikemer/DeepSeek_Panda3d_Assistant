This does not affect unanimated vertices, which are always\npacked tightly. This also impacts only vertex formats created within\nPanda subsystems; custom vertex formats are not affected. vertex-arrays bool 1 Set this true to allow the use of vertex arrays for rendering OpenGL\nvertex data. This, or vertex buffers, is the normal way of issuing\nvertices ever since OpenGL 1.1, and you almost always want to have this\nset to true. However, some very buggy graphics drivers may have problems\nhandling vertex arrays correctly, so if you are experiencing problems\nyou might try setting this to false. If this is false, Panda will fall\nback to using immediate-mode commands like glVertex3f(), etc., to issue\nthe vertices, which is potentially much slower than vertex arrays.\nSetting this false also disables vertex buffers, effectively ignoring\nthe setting of the vertex-buffers variable (since vertex buffers are a\nspecial case of vertex arrays in OpenGL).
