  "content": "The chunk describes how to create automatic texture animations using the egg-texture-cards utility, which generates a model that cycles through textures at a specified frame rate when added to the scene graph.\n\nAutomatic Texture Animation\n\nIt's possible to generate a model that automatically rotates through a sequence of textures when it is in the scene graph, without having to run a special task to handle this.\n\nTo do this, use the egg-texture-cards command-line utility. This program will accept a number of texture filenames on the command line, and output an egg file that rotates through each texture at the specified frame rate:\n\negg-texture-cards -o flip.egg -fps 30 explosion*.jpg\n\nThis actually creates a model with a different polygon for each frame of the texture animation. Each polygon is put in a separate node, and all the nodes are made a child of a special node called a .SequenceNode.",
