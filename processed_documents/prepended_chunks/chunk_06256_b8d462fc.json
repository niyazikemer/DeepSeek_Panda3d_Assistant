  "content": "To demonstrate how to apply multiple textures to a single model in Panda3D while preserving existing textures, we modify the previous example by creating and using an additional TextureStage.\n\nLet's revisit the example from simple-texture-replacement, where we replaced the normal texture on smiley.egg with a new texture image that contains a random color pattern. This time, instead of assigning the new texture to the default TextureStage, we'll create a new TextureStage for it, so that both textures will still be in effect:\n\nsmiley = loader.loadModel('smiley.egg')\nsmiley.reparentTo(render)\ntex = loader.loadTexture('maps/noise.rgb')\nts = TextureStage('ts')\nsmiley.setTexture(ts, tex)",
