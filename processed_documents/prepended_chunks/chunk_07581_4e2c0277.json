  "content": "The chunk describes a set of Panda3D executables focused on file conversions, particularly involving .egg, .bam, and other 3D model formats (e.g., DirectX, OpenFlight). These utilities include tools for converting between these formats, applying transformations to models, and extracting information from files.\n\nUseful for character models that stack on top of each other. See\nexecutable for more information egg-trans.exe Produces out essentially the same .egg file. Useful for applying\nrotational and positional transformations. See executable for more\ninformation. egg2bam.exe Converts files in the .egg format to the .bam format. For more\ninformation see converting-egg-to-bam . egg2c.exe Reads a .egg file and produce C/C++ code that will almost compile.\nSee executable for more information. egg2dxf.exe Converts files in the .egg format to the AutoCad format. egg2flt.exe Converts files in the .egg format to the Open Flight format. egg2x.exe Converts files in the .egg format to the DirectX format. Especially\nuseful because it holds bone, joint and animation data. flt-info.exe Reads an OpenFlight file and prints out information about its\ncontents. See executable for more information. flt-trans.exe Produces essentially the same .flt file. Useful for positional and",
