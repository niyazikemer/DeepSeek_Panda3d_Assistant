  "content": "The process of color interpolation between vertices is an essential aspect of how 3D hardware renders objects, as it demonstrates the GPU's ability to blend colors automatically without relying on shader programs.\n\nBack to the colors. If you have a red color (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) on one vertex and a dark blue color (0.0, 0.0, 0.5) on the other vertex the graphic card simply interpolates the color for every pixel between this two vertices, even without shaders (only if requested, but Panda3D ask the graphic card to do this). The graphic card doesn't know that a color comes in three parts: Red, Green and Blue. It only knows that it is manipulating values, in this case adjusting the constituent values for Red Green and Blue. Here is an example of how the graphic card interpolates:\n\nRed Vertex Blue Vertex Color value 100% 0% (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) 75% 25% (0.75, 0.0, 0.125) 50% 50% (0.5, 0.0, 0.25) 25% 75% (0.25, 0.0, 0.375) 0% 100% (0.0, 0.0, 0.5)",
