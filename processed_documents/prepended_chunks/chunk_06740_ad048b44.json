Depending on your graphics\ndriver, you may or may not get better performance or results by setting\nthis true. Setting it true may also allow you to take advantage of some\nexotic compression algorithm other than DXT1/3/5 that your graphics\ndriver supports, but which is unknown to Panda. If the libsquish library\nis not compiled into Panda, textures cannot be compressed in-memory, and\nwill always be handed to the graphics driver, regardless of this\nsetting. driver-generate-mipmaps bool 1 Set this true to use the hardware to generate mipmaps automatically\nin all cases, if supported. Set it false to generate mipmaps in software\nwhen possible. dump-generated-shaders bool 0 Set this true to cause all generated shaders to be written to disk.\nThis is useful for debugging broken shader generators. early-event-sphere bool 0 Set this to true in order to hit door triggers that are just",
