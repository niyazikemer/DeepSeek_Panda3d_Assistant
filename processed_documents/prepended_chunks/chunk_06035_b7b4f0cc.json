  "content": "Scalars are attributes assigned within various elements (Group, Joint, etc.) of an Egg file, defining properties like name or value for these components.\n\n<Scalar>\u00a0name\u00a0{\u00a0value\u00a0}\n\nScalars are attributes of the entry the Scalar is in. Name is the attribute name with value as the contents of that attribute.\n\nGlobal Information Entries\n\nThese nodes contain information relevant to the file as a whole. They can be nested along with geometry nodes, but this nesting is irrelevant and the only significant placement rule is that they should appear before they are referenced.\n\nCoordinate System\n\nThe coordinate system for the file is specified like so:\n\n\u00a0<CoordinateSystem>\u00a0{\u00a0string\u00a0}\n\nThis entry indicates the coordinate system used in the egg file; the egg loader will automatically make a conversion if necessary. The following strings are valid: Y-up, Z-up, Y-up-right, Z-up-right, Y-up-left, or Z-up-left. (Y-up is the same as Y-up-right, and Z-up is the same as Z-up-right.)\n\nTextures\n\nThis describes a texture file that can be referenced later with <TRef> { name }:",
