  "content": "The code chunk describes methods for loading and unloading models within a resource management class. The `loadModel` function retrieves a 3D model from a specified file path, while `unloadModel` handles freeing up resources associated with the loaded model. These methods are part of a comprehensive system designed to manage various types of assets efficiently in a software application.\n\nmodel = self.loadModel(modelPath, noCache = False)\n        if model is not None:\n            model = model.node()\n\n        return model\n\n    def unloadModel(self, model):\n        \"\"\"\n        model is the return value of loadModel().
