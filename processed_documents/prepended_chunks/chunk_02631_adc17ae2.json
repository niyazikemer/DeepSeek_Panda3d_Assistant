  "content": "The given code chunk is part of a Finite State Machine (FSM) class implementation in Python, which includes an asynchronous future setup, enumeration of special states, and initialization logic for managing state transitions. The context involves initializing key components such as locks, state management variables, and debug features to ensure proper FSM operation.\n\n```plaintext\nThe code initializes the FSM's core components, including asynchronous handling, special states (like ANY and DEFAULT), and setup for debugging. It sets up essential variables like the lock mechanism, state array, and initial state ('Off'), ensuring the FSM is ready for operations.\n```\n\n__doneFuture = AsyncFuture()\n    __doneFuture.set_result(None)\n\n    # An enum class for special states like the DEFAULT or ANY state,\n    # that should be treatened by the FSM in a special way\n    class EnumStates():\n        ANY = 1\n        DEFAULT = 2\n\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.fsmLock = RLock()\n        self._name = name\n        self.stateArray = []\n        self._serialNum = FSM.SerialNum\n        FSM.SerialNum += 1\n        self._broadcastStateChanges = False\n        # Initially, we are in the Off state by convention.\n        self.state = 'Off'\n\n        # This member records transition requests made by demand() or\n        # forceTransition() while the FSM is in transition between\n        # states.\n        self.__requestQueue = []\n\n        if __debug__:\n            from direct.fsm.ClassicFSM import _debugFsms\n            import weakref\n            _debugFsms[name]=weakref.ref(self)",
