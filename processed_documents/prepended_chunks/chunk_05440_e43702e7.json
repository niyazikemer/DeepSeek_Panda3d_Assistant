  "content": "The provided code chunk defines a method `deleteDistributedObjects` that cleans up and removes all distributed objects managed by the system. It iterates through all stored distributed objects, deletes each one using `deleteDistObject`, and then calls `deleteObjects()` to clean up related structures. Finally, it verifies that the `_doHierarchy` table is empty and issues a warning if it isn't, then clears it. This method is used for cleaning up or shutting down the system by ensuring all distributed objects and their associated data are properly removed.\n\n#----------------------------------\n\n    def deleteDistributedObjects(self):\n        # Get rid of all the distributed objects\n        for do in list(self.doId2do.values()):\n            self.deleteDistObject(do)\n\n        # Get rid of everything that manages distributed objects\n        self.deleteObjects()\n\n        # the zoneId2doIds table should be empty now\n        if not self._doHierarchy.isEmpty():\n            self.notify.warning(\n                '_doHierarchy table not empty: %s' % self._doHierarchy)\n            self._doHierarchy.clear()",
