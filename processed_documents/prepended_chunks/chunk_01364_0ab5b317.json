  "content": "The provided chunk discusses the concept of component groups in DirectGUI, which allows widgets to have shared configuration settings applied to multiple components through keyword arguments. This is situated within the context of explaining how widgets are constructed and configured, focusing on simplifying the process of applying properties across related components.\n\nGroups allow option specifications that apply to all members of the group.\n    If a widget has components: 'text1', 'text2', and 'text3' which all belong\n    to the 'text' group, they can be all configured with keywords of the form:\n    'text_keyword' (e.g. ``text_font='comic.rgb'``).  A component's group\n    is stored as the fourth element of its entry in self.__componentInfo.\n\n    Note: the widget constructors have access to all remaining keywords in\n    _constructorKeywords (those not transferred to _optionInfo by\n    define/addoptions).  If a component defines an alias that applies to\n    one of the keywords, that keyword is replaced with a new keyword with\n    the alias expanded.",
