  "content": "This chunk consists of several method definitions for a class (likely `FreezeTool`), including `reset()`, `mangleName()`, and `getAllModuleNames()`. These methods are related to managing module freezing state, handling module name mangling, and collecting all included module names during the freezing process. This code is situated within a larger system responsible for freezing Python modules into executable formats, specifically focusing on module management and state handling between freezing passes.\n\nif tempPath:\n                del self.mf.path[-1]\n\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, we can just import it normally.\n            self.mf.import_hook(mdef.moduleName)\n\n    def reset(self):\n        \"\"\" After a previous call to done(), this resets the\n        FreezeTool object for a new pass.
