  "content": "The chunk describes Panda3D's utility functions, including the `inspect()` method for examining object attributes, and other tools like `place()`, `explore()`, and `rgbPanel()` for manipulating NodePaths. These utilities are part of the directtools suite or can be used independently if the suite is disabled, aiding developers in debugging, visualizing scene graphs, and adjusting colors during 3D development.\n\nUtility Functions\n\nPanda3D has a set of utilities that may be used to learn more about various objects and methods within an application.\n\nOne of these commands is ~direct.tkpanels.Inspector.inspect(). This command will create a window with methods and attributes on one side, and the details of a selected attribute on the other. It also displays the current values of a class\u2019 attributes. If these attributes are changing, you may have to click on a value to refresh it. To use it you have to do the following:\n\nfrom direct.tkpanels.Inspector import inspect\ninspect(NodePath)\n# e.g. inspect(camera)\n\nWhile the directtools suite calls upon a number of tools, if the suite is disabled, the user may activate certain panels of the suite. The place() command opens the object placer console. The explore() opens the scene graph explorer, which allows you to inspect the hierarchy of a NodePath. Finally, in order to change the color of a NodePath, the rgbPanel() command opens color panel.",
