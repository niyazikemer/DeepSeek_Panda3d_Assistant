  "content": "The chunk explains how to load a 3-D texture using `loader.load3DTexture()` by specifying a filename pattern with placeholders for slice indices, allowing for flexible and efficient referencing of multiple texture files.\n\ntex = loader.load3DTexture(\"grid_#.png\")\n\nThe hash sign (\"#\") in the filename passed to loader.load3DTexture() <direct.showbase.Loader.Loader.load3DTexture> will be filled in with the sequence number of each slice, so the above loads files named \"grid_0.png\", \"grid_1.png\", \"grid_2.png\", and so on. If you prefer to pad the slice number with zeros to a certain number of digits, repeat the hash sign; for instance, loading \"grid_###.png\" would look for files named \"grid_000.png\", \"grid_001.png\", and so on. Note that you don't have to use multiple hash marks to count higher than 9. You can count as high as you like even with only one hash mark; it just won't pad the numbers with zeros.",
