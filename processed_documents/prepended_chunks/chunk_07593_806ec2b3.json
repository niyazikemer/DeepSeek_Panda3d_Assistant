  "content": "The document provides an overview of normal mapping in Panda3D, including how to use built-in capabilities for achieving lifelike surface effects without needing shader programming. The chunk discusses the challenges associated with writing custom shaders when panda's automated shader synthesis is insufficient or when more specialized rendering techniques are required.\n\nThe problem with panda's shader synthesis capabilities is that they can only synthesize the shaders that people usually need. If what you need is esoteric, you'll have to write your own shader.\n\nThere are two difficulties associated with writing your own shader. The first is that you need to know shader programming. Teaching shader programming is beyond the scope of this tutorial. Panda uses the Cg shader language, which you can learn elsewhere. Furthermore, normal mapping shaders are more complex than most. The mathematics involved in normal mapping are quite complex, which puts writing a normal mapping shader even further outside the scope of this tutorial.",
