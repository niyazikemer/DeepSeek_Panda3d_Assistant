  "content": "This chunk introduces foundational components of a distributed object management system, including:\n\n1. `objectsByZoneId`: A global mapping of zones to their associated objects\n2. `doIdRange`: Fixed range of unique identifiers assigned per client connection\n3. `idAllocator`: Manages assignment of unique identifier blocks to clients\n4. DC file handling: Parses distributed class definitions for object templates\n5. Flush task: Periodic message flushing mechanism for efficient communication\n\nThe code initializes these core structures and parameters necessary for managing distributed objects across zones and maintaining client connections in a networked environment.\n\n# A dictionary of zoneId -> set([Object]), listing the\n        # distributed objects assigned to each zone, globally.\n        self.objectsByZoneId = {}\n\n        # The number of doId's to assign to each client.
