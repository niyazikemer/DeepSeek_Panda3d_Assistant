The variables `self.camList`, `self.camNode`, and others are initialized within the `Base` class's `__init__` method, managing camera attributes and GUI application references (wx and Tk). These attributes are essential for window controls, including handling multiple cameras, input devices, and rendering settings.\n\n#: A list of all cameras created with `makeCamera()`, including `cam`.\n        self.camList: list[NodePath] = []\n        #: Convenience accessor for base.cam.node(), containing a\n        #: :class:`~panda3d.core.Camera` object.\n        self.camNode: Camera | None = None\n        #: Convenience accessor for base.camNode.get_lens(), containing a\n        #: :class:`~panda3d.core.Lens` object.\n        self.camLens: Lens | None = None\n        self.camFrustumVis: NodePath | None = None\n        self.direct = None\n        #: This is used to store the wx.Application object used when want-wx is\n        #: set or `startWx()` is called.\n        self.wxApp: Any | None = None\n        self.wxAppCreated = False\n        self.tkRoot: Any | None = None\n        self.tkRootCreated = False",
