  "content": "The chunk describes settings for the Egg Loader in Panda3D, explaining how specific configuration options like `egg-load-old-curves` affect NURBS curve loading and parameters such as maximum indices and triangle fan angles. This section is part of a comprehensive configuration guide within the document, focusing on fine-tuning the egg loader's behavior for different environments or performance needs.\n\nentry appearing in an egg file will load a ClassicNurbsCurve object\ninstead of the default, a NurbsCurve object. This only makes a\ndifference when the NURBS++ library is available, in which case the\ndefault, NurbsCurve, is actually a NurbsPPCurve object. egg-load-old-curves bool 1 When this is true, a <NurbsCurve> entry appearing in an egg\nfile will load as a NurbsCurve or ClassicNurbsCurve object (see below).\nWhen this is false, it will load a RopeNode instead, which uses the new\nNurbsCurveEvaluator interface. egg-max-indices int 65535 Specifies the maximum number of vertex indices that will be added to\nany one GeomPrimitive by the egg loader. egg-max-tfan-angle double 40.0 The maximum average angle per triangle to allow in a triangle fan.\nIf triangles are larger than this--that is, more loosely packed--then we\nfigure a triangle strip is likely to do a more effective job than a",
