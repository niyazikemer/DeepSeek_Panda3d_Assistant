  "content": "The chunk describes the concept and implementation of flocking behavior using PandAI's system, explaining how cohesive, separation, and alignment forces create emergent group movement. It details how each NPC uses a visibility cone to identify neighbors and applies weighted forces for realistic collective motion while emphasizing that flocking must combine with other steering behaviors like pursue or evade.\n\nFlock\n\nWhat is flocking? Flocking is an emergent behavior and is the resultant of the following forces:\n\ncohesion -- finds average position of neighbors and tries to move to that position separation -- object keeps a certain distance between itself and its neighbor alignment -- finds average direction in which all neighbors are moving and tries to move in that direction\n\nEach NPC has a \"visibility cone\" and this is used to compute it's neighbors. The neighbors contribute towards the forces mentioned above.\n\nTuners:\n\nThe angle and length of each NPC's \"visibility cone\".\n\nWeight of cohesion, separation, and alignment (how much each sub-behavior of flock affects the overall flocking behavior).\n\nNote\n\nFlocking behavior is NOT a standalone behavior. It needs to be combined with other steering behaviors such as seek, pursue, flee, evade etc. to function.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkfnlqH06IY\n\nUsing PandAI's flocking system:",
