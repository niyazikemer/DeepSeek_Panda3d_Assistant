  "content": "The provided chunk is part of a Python class that extends DirectAnalog functionality to handle joystick input normalization. The `normalizeChannel` method overrides the default behavior to adjust normalization ranges specifically for twist axes (L_TWIST and R_TWIST), which have reduced operational ranges compared to other controls. This ensures accurate scaling of input values within specified bounds, critical for precise control in applications like games or simulations.\n\n# We need to override the DirectAnalog normalizeChannel to\n    # correct the ranges of the two twist axes of the joybox.\n\n    def normalizeChannel(self, chan, minVal = -1, maxVal = 1):\n        try:\n            if chan == L_TWIST or chan == R_TWIST:\n                # These channels have reduced range\n                return self.analogs.normalize(\n                    self.analogs.getControlState(chan), minVal, maxVal, 3.0)\n            else:\n                return self.analogs.normalize(\n                    self.analogs.getControlState(chan), minVal, maxVal)\n        except IndexError:\n            return 0.0",
