  "content": "The provided code chunk includes three methods from the DoHierarchy class: __len__, clear, and getDoIds. These methods are responsible for managing and retrieving object IDs within a distributed system context. \n\n- The `__len__` method returns the total count of objects stored in the hierarchy by checking the size of `_allDoIds`.\n- The `clear` method resets both the internal table (`_table`) and the set of all object IDs (`_allDoIds`), effectively emptying the hierarchy.\n- The `getDoIds` method retrieves object IDs based on specified parameters, allowing filtering by parent ID, zone ID, and distributed class type, facilitating efficient data retrieval.\n\ndef __len__(self):\n        return len(self._allDoIds)\n\n    def clear(self):\n        assert self.notify.debugCall()\n        self._table = {}\n        self._allDoIds = set()\n\n    def getDoIds(self, getDo, parentId, zoneId=None, classType=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Args:\n            parentId: any distributed object id.\n            zoneId: a uint32, defaults to None (all zones).
