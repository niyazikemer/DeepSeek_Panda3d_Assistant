  "content": "The chunk describes the 'Flee' AI behavior in PandAI, where an AICharacter moves away from a target NodePath or position. It explains the implementation details of the `flee` method, including parameters like panic distance, relax distance, and priority, and provides a working demo code example to illustrate its usage.\n\nFlee\n\n'Flee' is an AI behavior where an AICharacter will move in the opposite direction to a target NodePath or position.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXzzuK2Vnnk\n\nIn PandAI, 'Flee' is defined as:\n\naiBehaviors.flee(NodePath target, double panic_distance, double relax_distance, float priority)\naiBehaviors.flee(Vec3 position, double panic_distance, double relax_distance, float priority)\n\nwhere:\n\nPanic Distance is the radius of detection.\n\nRelax Distance is the distance from the panic distance radius after which the object should stop fleeing once flee has been initiated.\n\npriority is by default set to 1.0 and is used when using two or more steering behaviors on an AICharacter.\n\nThe velocity at which the AICharacter flees is determined when you first create your AICharacter object using the AICharacter constructor.\n\nNote: 'Flee' takes in a target or a position to be fled away from; this position should be static. (For moving objects use Evade).\n\nA fully working flee demo :",
