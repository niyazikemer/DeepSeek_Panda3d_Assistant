  "content": "The chunk consists of several methods related to distributed object management: `sendDeleteMsg` for sending deletion messages, `taskName` and `uniqueName` for generating unique identifiers based on task strings or ID strings combined with the object's doId. The docstring explains that these functions are part of a class handling message passing between objects in a networked environment.\n\ndef sendDeleteMsg(self):\n        self.cr.sendDeleteMsg(self.doId)\n\n    def taskName(self, taskString):\n        return \"%s-%s\" % (taskString, self.doId)\n\n    def uniqueName(self, idString):\n        return \"%s-%s\" % (idString, self.doId)\n\n    def getCallbackContext(self, callback, extraArgs = []):\n        # Some objects implement a back-and-forth handshake operation\n        # with the AI via an arbitrary context number.  This method\n        # (coupled with doCallbackContext(), below) maps a Python\n        # callback onto that context number so that client code may\n        # easily call the method and wait for a callback, rather than\n        # having to negotiate context numbers.\n\n        # This method generates a new context number and stores the\n        # callback so that it may later be called when the response is\n        # returned.\n\n        # This is intended to be called within derivations of\n        # DistributedObject, not directly by other objects.",
