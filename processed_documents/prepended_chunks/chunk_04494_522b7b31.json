  "content": "The chunk contains two helper methods, `_isDeadEnd` and `_hasLength`, which are part of a larger class designed for leak detection in Python. The `_isDeadEnd` method checks if an object should be ignored during leak checks to prevent infinite recursion or crashes, while the `_hasLength` method determines if an object has a defined length. These methods support the main functionality of the class by enabling safe and efficient traversal of objects during leak detection.\n\ndef _isDeadEnd(self, obj, objName=None):\n        if type(obj) in deadEndTypes:\n            return True\n\n        # if it's an internal object, ignore it\n        if id(obj) in ContainerLeakDetector.PrivateIds:\n            return True\n        # prevent crashes in objects that define __cmp__ and don't handle strings\n        if type(objName) == str and objName in ('im_self', 'im_class'):\n            return True\n        try:\n            className = obj.__class__.__name__\n        except Exception:\n            pass\n        else:\n            # prevent infinite recursion in built-in containers related to methods\n            if className == 'method-wrapper':\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    def _hasLength(self, obj):\n        return hasattr(obj, '__len__')",
