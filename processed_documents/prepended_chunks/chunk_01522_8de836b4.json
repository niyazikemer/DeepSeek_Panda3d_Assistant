  "content": "The chunk contains methods for enabling index-style references and destroying instances of the OnscreenGeom class. These methods are located towards the end of the OnscreenGeom class definition, after the core functionality for setting up and configuring the geometry is defined. This includes support for dictionary-like access to configuration options (via `__setitem__` and `cget`) and a method to clean up the object by removing its node from the scene graph (`destroy`).\n\n# Allow index style references\n    def __setitem__(self, key, value):\n        self.configure(*(), **{key: value})\n\n    def cget(self, option):\n        # Get current configuration setting.\n        # This is for compatibility with DirectGui functions\n        getter = getattr(self, 'get' + option[0].upper() + option[1:])\n        return getter()\n\n    # Allow index style refererences\n    __getitem__ = cget\n\n    def destroy(self):\n        self.removeNode()",
