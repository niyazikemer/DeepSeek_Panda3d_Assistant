  "content": "The chunk provides an introductory overview of Distributed Objects (DOs) within a distributed network, explaining their purpose, creation process, zone-based visibility, and ownership rules.\n\nDistributed Objects\n\nDistributedObjects are the base for all things that should be managed over the distributed network. This may include players, level objects, the level itself, a message object for chat messages and really anything else in the application world.\n\nAs seen in earlier sections, they can be created on the client repositories and, when created, they will automatically be distributed to other clients.\n\nTo define who will see DOs <DO>, they can be set in specific zones. Zones are just numbers that have to be set on a DO and a client needs to show interest in them to be able to see objects in them. In addition, objects that a client doesn't own can't be updated by that client. Only the object's owner can change fields in it, except if they are specially marked with the clsend keyword in the DC definition file.",
