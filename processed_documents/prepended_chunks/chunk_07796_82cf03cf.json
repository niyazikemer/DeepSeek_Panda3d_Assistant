  "content": "This chunk is an introductory section explaining how to manipulate actor joints in Panda3D to achieve character movement, specifically controlling neck and hand joints to make a character \"look\" at the mouse cursor and grip objects.\n\nSample Programs: Looking and Gripping\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nThis tutorial will cover how you can manipulate actor joints in Panda. Joints are essentially bones used by a 3D package (Maya, 3D Studio, XSI, etc) to deform a character. The model is bound to these joints and moving these joints will cause the model to deform. For example, rotating the shoulder joint will move the arms, rotating the leg joints will bend the legs. In Panda, these joints are normally not accessible. However, by controlling them with controlJoint, you can manipulate the orientation of that joint in Panda independent of its preloaded animations. You could even use a model without premade animations and manipulate the joints manually in Panda.",
