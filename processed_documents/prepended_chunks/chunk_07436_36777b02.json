  "content": "The document discusses the structure and organization of vertex data in Panda, focusing on the `GeomVertexData` object, which stores vertex information as a table with various columns representing different attributes like position, normal, color, and texture coordinates. The chunk describes how this data can be broken into separate arrays, such as splitting vertex and texture coordinate data into one array and normal and color data into another, to allow for efficient reuse of certain columns across multiple `GeomVertexData` objects while considering potential performance implications.\n\nnormal color 0 (0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 1, 1) 1 (0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 1, 1) 2 (0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 1, 1) 3 (0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 1, 1)\n\nYou might want to do this, for instance, if you have certain columns of data that are always the same between different blocks of vertices; you can put those columns in a separate array, and then use the same array within multiple different GeomVertexData objects. There is no limit to the number of different arrays you can have within one GeomVertexData; you can make each column a separate array if you like. (There may be performance implications to consider. Some graphics drivers may work better with one block of contiguous data--one array--while others may prefer many different arrays. This performance difference is likely to be small, however.)",
