  "content": "The provided chunk is part of a Python class responsible for managing parent-child relationships, particularly in scenarios where objects need to be dynamically reparented as their designated parents become available. The code handles adding pending children once their designated parent (identified by a token) has been registered. This functionality ensures that when a parent becomes available, all previously waiting children are correctly assigned to this parent, maintaining the correct object hierarchy and positioning during dynamic updates or zone transitions in a game or simulation environment.\n\n# if we have any pending children, add them\n        if token in self.pendingParentToken2children:\n            children = self.pendingParentToken2children[token]\n            del self.pendingParentToken2children[token]\n            for child in children:\n                # NOTE: We do a plain-old reparentTo here (non-wrt)\n                # under the assumption that the node has been\n                # positioned as if it is already under the new parent.\n                #\n                # The only case that I can think of where the parent\n                # node would not have been registered at the time of\n                # the reparent request is when we're entering a new\n                # zone and manifesting remote toons along with\n                # other distributed objects, and a remote toon is\n                # requesting to be parented to geometry owned by a\n                # distributed object that has not yet been manifested.\n                #",
