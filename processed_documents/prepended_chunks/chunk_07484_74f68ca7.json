  "content": "The chunk explains how users can create their own PStatCollectors by defining unique names with optional parent hierarchies using colon separators, allowing custom timing or data recording in the PStats system.\n\n</context>\n\nHOW TO DEFINE YOUR OWN COLLECTORS\n\nThe PStats client code is designed to be generic enough to allow users to define their own collectors to time any arbitrary blocks of code (or record additional non-time-based data), from either the C++ or the Python level.\n\nThe general idea is to create a PStatCollector for each separate block of code you wish to time. The name which is passed to the PStatCollector constructor is a unique identifier: all collectors that share the same name are deemed to be the same collector.\n\nFurthermore, the collector's name can be used to define the hierarchical relationship of each collector with other existing collectors. To do this, prefix the collector's name with the name of its parent(s), followed by a colon separator. For instance, PStatCollector(\"Draw:Flip\") defines a collector named \"Flip\", which is a child of the \"Draw\" collector, defined elsewhere.\n\n</context>\n\nHOW TO DEFINE YOUR OWN COLLECTORS\n\nThe PStats client code is designed to be generic enough to allow users to define their own collectors to time any arbitrary blocks of code (or record additional non-time-based data), from either the C++ or the Python level.\n\nThe general idea is to create a PStatCollector for each separate block of code you wish to time.
