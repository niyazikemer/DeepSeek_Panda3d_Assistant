  "content": "The chunk discusses recommendations for providing icons at various resolutions when setting up application icons in Panda3D, emphasizing best practices to ensure clarity across different sizes.\n\nYou can provide a single image file of at least 256\u00d7256 and Panda3D will scale it down to smaller sizes as needed, but because automatic scaling can make the icon look illegible at smaller sizes, we highly recommend providing custom-scaled versions at resolutions 16, 32, 48, 128, and 256. For best results, it also doesn't hurt to provide icons in additional resolutions, such as 24, 64, 96, 512, and 1024.",
