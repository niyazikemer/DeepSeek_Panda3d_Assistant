  "content": "This chunk situates within a comprehensive guide on navigation mesh generation for 3D software users, specifically addressing Maya and Blender workflows. It provides critical instructions for Maya Users regarding egg file conversion and Blender Users tips for creating meshes in the x-y plane with optimal scale sizes.\n\nMesh Generation\n\nNavigation Mesh\n\nTo create a navigation mesh, you need a 3D software such as 3DS Max, Maya or Blender. Please follow the tutorial videos below to understand the process:\n\nStep 1:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACLuXWkpJhU\n\nStep 2:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rug0eYBa88M\n\nNote: There are separate versions of the mesh generation tool for \"Maya/Max\" users and \"Blender\" users. Make sure you download the correct version.\n\nMaya Users (IMPORTANT)\n\nSince the egg file produced by Maya uses a different format from 3DSMax, you will need to first convert them into the same format (triangles) by using the following command:\n\nC:\\Panda3D-|release|-x64\\bin\\egg-trans -C -o out.egg in.egg\n\nThe egg file that is thereby generated should be passed to the Mesh Generation Tool.\n\nBlender Users (IMPORTANT)",
