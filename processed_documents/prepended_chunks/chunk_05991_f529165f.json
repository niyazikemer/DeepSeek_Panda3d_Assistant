However, this is not considered reliable at this time, so it is not done by Panda3D automatically. It is suggested to document this as a possibility for your end-users or add an option for this setting that can be disabled.\n\nWhen distributing a .desktop file, it is also possible to add the following key to the file:\n\nPrefersNonDefaultGPU=true",
