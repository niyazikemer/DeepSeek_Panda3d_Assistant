  "content": "The `mouseUpdate` method is a crucial part of the `DisplayRegionContext` class, which is designed to manage display regions for multiple camera perspectives in a 3D rendering environment. This method handles mouse position updates, capturing the current mouse coordinates relative to the window, computing delta movements since the last frame, and setting up a near vector (`nearVec`) based on these positions. It plays a vital role in maintaining accurate mouse data across different display regions within the broader `DisplayRegionContextManager` system, ensuring smooth interaction with 3D scenes.\n\ndef mouseUpdate(self):\n        # Mouse Data\n        # Last frame\n        self.mouseLastX = self.mouseX\n        self.mouseLastY = self.mouseY\n\n        # Values for this frame\n        # This ranges from -1 to 1\n        mouseWatcherNode = base.mouseWatcherNode\n        if mouseWatcherNode and mouseWatcherNode.hasMouse():\n            self.mouseX = mouseWatcherNode.getMouseX()\n            self.mouseY = mouseWatcherNode.getMouseY()\n            self.mouseX = (self.mouseX-self.originX)*self.scaleX\n            self.mouseY = (self.mouseY-self.originY)*self.scaleY\n        # Delta percent of window the mouse moved\n        self.mouseDeltaX = self.mouseX - self.mouseLastX\n        self.mouseDeltaY = self.mouseY - self.mouseLastY\n        self.nearVec.set((self.nearWidth*0.5) * self.mouseX,\n                         self.near,\n                         (self.nearHeight*0.5) * self.mouseY)",
