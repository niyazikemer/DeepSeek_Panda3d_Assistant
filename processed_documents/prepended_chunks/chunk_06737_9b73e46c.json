This has no\neffect in NDEBUG mode. dev-run-multiplier double 4.0 Used in DevWalker, which is intended for avatar movement testing.\nThis controls the movement speed of the avatar. direct-gui-edit bool 0 DConfig direct-wtext bool 1 disable-sticky-keys bool 0 DConfig display string Specify the X display string for the default display. If this is not\nspecified, $DISPLAY is used. display-list-animation bool 0 Set this true to allow the use of OpenGL display lists for rendering\nanimated geometry (when the geometry is animated by the hardware).
