  "content": "This chunk is part of an EGG file specification document detailing \"Other Group Attributes,\" specifically explaining how to use Billboard and SwitchCondition entries within group definitions. The Billboard entry configures geometry to rotate towards the camera with axis or point rotation, while SwitchCondition controls visibility based on distance from a reference vertex.\n\nThe section explains that billboarded geometry uses local coordinates relative to the billboard's pivot, not global scene coordinates, and outlines the structure of a SwitchCondition for conditional rendering based on proximity.\n\nOther Group Attributes\n\nBillboard\n\n<Billboard>\u00a0{\u00a0type\u00a0}\n\nThis entry indicates that all geometry defined at or below this group level is part of a billboard that will rotate to face the camera. Type is either \"axis\" or \"point\", describing the type of rotation.\n\nBillboards rotate about their local axis. In the case of a Y-up file, the billboards rotate about the Y axis; in a Z-up file, they rotate about the Z axis. Point-rotation billboards rotate about the origin.\n\nThere is an implicit <Instance> around billboard geometry. This means that the geometry within a billboard is not specified in world coordinates, but in the local billboard space. Thus, a vertex drawn at point 0,0,0 will appear to be at the pivot point of the billboard, not at the origin of the scene.\n\nSwitchCondition\n\n\u00a0 <SwitchCondition>\u00a0{\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Distance>\u00a0{\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0out\u00a0[fade]\u00a0<Vertex>\u00a0{\u00a0x\u00a0y\u00a0z\u00a0}\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}\n\u00a0 }",
