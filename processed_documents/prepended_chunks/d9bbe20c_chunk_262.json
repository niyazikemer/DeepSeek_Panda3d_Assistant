  "content": "This code appears to be part of a graphical user interface (GUI) implementation for an animation or data visualization tool, specifically handling the rendering of keyframes on a graph editor canvas. The chunk is likely situated within the `OnPaint` method of a custom wxPython window class (possibly named `GraphEditorWindow`), responsible for visually representing selected keyframes with colored circles. The code checks if a keyframe is selected (`AG.SELECT == 0` or `1`) and draws black or cyan circles accordingly, allowing users to visually identify selected keyframes in the graph editor interface.\n\nif list[i][AG.KEYFRAME][AG.SELECT] == 0:\n                dc.SetPen(wx.Pen(\"black\", 3))\n                dc.SetBrush(wx.Brush(\"black\"))\n                dc.DrawCircle(pointX, pointY, 2)\n\n            if list[i][AG.KEYFRAME][AG.SELECT] == 1:\n                dc.SetPen(wx.Pen(\"cyan\", 3))\n                dc.SetBrush(wx.Brush(\"cyan\"))\n                dc.DrawCircle(pointX, pointY, 2)",
