  "content": "The document introduces two types of forces in Panda3D: LinearVectorForce and AngularVectorForce, explaining their application to objects within the physics system. The chunk focuses on the description, usage, and example implementation of LinearVectorForce in Python, detailing how it applies acceleration as a point mass without enabling rotation.\n\nTypes of forces\n\nPanda3D provides two types of forces that you can apply to an object.\n\nLinearVectorForce\n\nA ~panda3d.physics.LinearVectorForce treats the object as a point mass. It applies an acceleration in Newtons to the center of mass of the object it was added to. The direction of this force is relative to the orientation of the ~panda3d.physics.ForceNode that the ~panda3d.physics.LinearVectorForce was applied to.\n\nNote\n\nSince ~panda3d.physics.LinearVectorForce treats the object as a point mass, it is not possible to apply a rotation of any kind to your object. For rotational forces, see ~panda3d.physics.AngularVectorForce below.\n\nExample:\n\npython\n\nlvf = LinearVectorForce(1, 0, 0)  # Push 1 newton in the positive-x direction\nforceNode.addForce(lvf)  # Determine coordinate space of this force node\nactorNode.getPhysical(0).addLinearForce(lvf) # Add the force to the object\n\ncpp",
