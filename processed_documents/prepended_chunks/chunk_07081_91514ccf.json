  "content": "The note appears in a section discussing advanced texture handling options in Panda3D, specifically addressing situations where non-power-of-two textures are enabled. It follows a caution about potential issues with auto-detecting video card capabilities for non-power-of-two textures and provides additional guidance on how to handle dynamic textures effectively by leveraging Panda3D's scaling capabilities rather than relying on potentially inefficient driver behavior.\n\nNote\n\nNote that some cards appear to be able to render non-power-of-two textures, but the driver is really just scaling the textures at load time. With cards like these, you're better off letting Panda do the scaling, or dynamic textures may render very slowly.",
