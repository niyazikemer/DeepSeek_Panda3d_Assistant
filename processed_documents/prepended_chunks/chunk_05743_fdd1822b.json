  "content": "This code chunk defines a deprecated `pPrintString` method for the NodePath class. The method generates a formatted string containing information about the node's position, HPR (heading-pitch-roll), scale, shear, and other properties. It is part of a larger collection of utility methods added to the NodePath class, including scene graph analysis tools like `analyze`, collision tree construction methods (`subdivideCollisions`, `r_subdivideCollisions`), and helper functions for constructing and managing collision nodes. The method uses Python's warnings module to deprecate itself while providing debugging information about node transformations.\n\ndef pPrintString(self, other = None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Deprecated.  pretty print\n    \"\"\"\n    if __debug__:\n        warnings.warn(\"NodePath.pPrintString() is deprecated.\", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)\n        # Normally I would have put the if __debug__ around\n        # the entire funciton, the that doesn't seem to work\n        # with -extensions.
