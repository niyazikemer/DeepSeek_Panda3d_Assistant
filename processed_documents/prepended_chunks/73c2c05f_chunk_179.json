  "content": "The provided code chunk is part of a larger Python module that sets up a graphical user interface (GUI) for a 3D visualization application using wxPython and Panda3D's Direct tools. The imports include necessary libraries such as `wx` for GUI components, `fourwaysplitter` from wx.lib.agw for managing window layouts, and modules from Direct for viewport management. The defined IDs (e.g., ID_TOP_VIEW) are used to identify different views within the application's interface. This chunk is situated at the beginning of the document, followed by a class that configures a four-way splitter window system, integrating multiple viewports including top, front, left, and perspective views for 3D object manipulation and visualization.\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nimport wx\nfrom wx.lib.agw import fourwaysplitter as FWS\n\nfrom direct.showbase.ShowBase import ShowBase\nfrom direct.showbase import ShowBaseGlobal\nfrom direct.directtools.DirectGlobals import SKIP_UNPICKABLE\nfrom direct.task.TaskManagerGlobal import taskMgr\n\nfrom .WxAppShell import WxAppShell\nfrom .ViewPort import Viewport, ViewportManager\n\nID_FOUR_VIEW = 401\nID_TOP_VIEW = 402\nID_FRONT_VIEW = 403\nID_LEFT_VIEW = 404\nID_PERSP_VIEW = 405",
