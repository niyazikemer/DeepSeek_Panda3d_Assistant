  "content": "The chunk of code is part of the `ProjectileInterval` class, specifically within the `_calcTrajectory` method. It handles the scenario where the projectile's motion is defined by passing through a specific point (waypoint) at a given time and then continuing until it reaches a specified Z-plane. The code calculates the time required for the projectile to reach this Z-plane, sets the interval duration accordingly, and includes error handling if the projectile cannot reach the target plane.\n\nContext:  \nThis code manages projectile motion constraints where the projectile passes through a waypoint at a set time and stops upon reaching a specific Z-height. It calculates the necessary duration and handles cases where reaching the target Z is impossible.\n\ntime = calcTimeOfLastImpactOnPlane(\n                self.startPos[2], endZ, self.startVel[2], self.zAcc)\n            if time is None:\n                self.notify.error(\n                    'projectile never reaches plane Z=%s' % endZ)\n            self.duration = time\n            self.endPos = None\n        else:\n            self.notify.error('invalid set of inputs to ProjectileInterval')",
