  "content": "The `Indirection` class is part of a system designed to detect memory leaks by tracking references to Python containers and their contents. It provides a mechanism for safely dereferencing elements within containers, storing string representations or dictionary keys that may be garbage-collected, thereby enabling the detection of potential memory leaks in complex object graphs.\n\nclass Indirection:\n    \"\"\"\n    Represents the indirection that brings you from a container to an element of the container.\n    Stored as a string to be used as part of an eval, or as a key to be looked up in a dict.\n    Each dictionary dereference is individually eval'd since the dict key might have been\n    garbage-collected\n    TODO: store string components that are duplicates of strings in the actual system so that\n    Python will keep one copy and reduce memory usage\n    \"\"\"",
