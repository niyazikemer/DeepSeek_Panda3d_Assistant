  "content": "The chunk discusses method (3) for enabling stereo output by setting `side-by-side-stereo 1` in the Config. prc file, which renders two views side-by-side for development purposes or environments like head-mounted displays.\n\n(3) You put side-by-side-stereo 1 in your Config.prc file. This is similar to red-blue-stereo, above, but the two views are rendered side-by-side in the same window. This is useful for developing stereo applications, so you can see each view easily; it may also be useful for environments such as head-mounted displays where the output spans two different displays, and each display represents a different eye.",
