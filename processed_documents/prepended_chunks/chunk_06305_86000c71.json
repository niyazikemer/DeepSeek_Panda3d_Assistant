  "content": "This chunk appears within a document discussing advanced features of the maya2egg exporter tool for Maya, specifically focusing on batch processing optimizations and texture optimization using the egg-palettize tool.\n\nAnother useful feature of the application is that it checks the modified date of every file used as an input for the given utility (ie the .mb file for an exporter batch command, and an egg file for egg2bam). This is handy if you have saved out an entire batch list of 20 files but only need to export the three files you actually changed. The exporter skips any unchanged files by default, but this behavior can be overridden by checking the \u201cOverride export changed files\u201d checkbox next to the Run Batch button.\n\nUsing the Egg-Palettize Tool\n\nFor viewing the video tutorial click here\n\nEgg-palettize is an optimization tool in Panda for you to group your textures. You can have your textures placed in a single palette. In the advanced mode of the GUI, choose the egg-palettize panel. This is the egg-palettize Tool.\n\nFor using egg-palettize on a single egg file select that option in the drop down list:",
