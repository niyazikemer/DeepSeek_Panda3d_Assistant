  "content": "The code chunk is part of a `run` method within a Python class that manages object reference traversal and leak checking tasks. The method initializes variables for tracking objects during traversal, enters an infinite loop to yield control periodically, and selects starting references for new traversals when necessary. This method is critical for non-blocking execution of object leak detection processes, allowing other tasks to run while waiting for the next traversal step.\n\n**Context:**\nThe `run` method manages periodic object reference traversal and leak checking by initializing traversal variables, yielding control to allow task switching, and selecting starting references for new traversals when needed. This supports efficient non-blocking execution of leak detection in a scheduled job system.\n\ndef run(self):\n        try:\n            # this yields a different set of start refs every time we start a new traversal\n            # force creation of a new workingListSelector inside the while loop right off the bat\n            workingListSelector = nullGen()\n            # this holds the current step of the current traversal\n            curObjRef = None\n            while True:\n                # yield up here instead of at the end, since we skip back to the\n                # top of the while loop from various points\n                yield None\n                #import pdb;pdb.set_trace()\n                if curObjRef is None:\n                    # choose an object to start a traversal from\n                    try:\n                        startRefWorkingList = next(workingListSelector)\n                    except StopIteration:\n                        # do relative # of traversals on each set based on how many refs it contains",
