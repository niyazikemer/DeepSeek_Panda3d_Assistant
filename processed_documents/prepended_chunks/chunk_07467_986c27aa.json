  "content": "The provided chunk serves as an introductory section to PStats, outlining its role as Panda's built-in performance analysis tool. It explains how PStats helps in measuring frame rates and analyzing workloads within frames, while also mentioning its capability to display various types of frame-based data. This introduction situates the reader before delving into more detailed explanations of PStats' functionality, including its client-server architecture, data transmission methods, and visualization tools.\n\nMeasuring Performance with PStats\n\nQUICK INTRODUCTION\n\nPStats is Panda's built-in performance analysis tool. It can graph frame rate over time, and can further graph the work spent within each frame into user-defined subdivisions of the frame (for instance, app, cull and draw), and thus can be an invaluable tool in identifying performance bottlenecks. It can also show frame-based data that reflects any arbitrary quantity other than time intervals, for instance, texture memory in use or number of vertices drawn.\n\nThe performance graphs may be drawn on the same computer that is running the Panda client, or they may be drawn on another computer on the same LAN, which is useful for analyzing fullscreen applications. The remote computer need not be running the same operating system as the client computer.",
