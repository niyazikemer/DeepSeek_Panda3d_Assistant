  "content": "The chunk introduces a minimal \"hello world\" program using Panda3D and Bullet physics, demonstrating basic physics simulation. It explains compiling C++ Panda3D code with Bullet by linking against Bullet libraries, suitable for foundational understanding of integrating physics into applications.\n\nBullet Hello World\n\nThis page intends to lead through a minimal \"hello world\" program using Panda3D and Bullet physics.\n\ncpp\n\nCompiling C++ Panda3D with Bullet code\n\nTo compile a Panda3D C++ program with Bullet, you will need to link directly against the Bullet libraries.\n\nThese are not included in the Panda3D SDK, but are included in a separate \"thirdparty tools\" download on the download page. You will need to add the appropriate Bullet include and library directories to your compiler settings.\n\nOn Ubuntu, we compile against the Bullet version that is included in the Ubuntu distribution, and you can use pkg-config to determine the include and library paths for Bullet.\n\nWorld\n\nIn order to use Bullet physics we need to have a BulletWorld. The world is Panda3D's term for a \"space\" or \"scene\". The world holds physical objects like rigid bodies, soft bodies or character controllers. It controls global parameters, such a gravity, and it advances the simulation state.\n\npython",
