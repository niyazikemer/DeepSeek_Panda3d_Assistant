  "content": "The provided chunk introduces the \"Inspection Tools\" section of a document related to programming with Panda3D, explaining how to enable hot-key driven direct tools and the Direct Session Panel by setting specific variables in the config. This enables users to access debugging utilities for scene graph exploration and enhanced mouse navigation.\n\nInspection Tools\n\nThis section lists a number of tools to support programming in Panda.\n\nMany of the tools provided are invoked by pressing a hot-key inside of the Panda3D main window. These hot-key driven tools are called the \"direct tools.\" The direct tools are initially disabled, because the hot-keys used to invoke them might interfere with the program's own keys and events.\n\nTo enable the hot-keys for the direct tools, you need to set the want-directtools variable in config.prc, the main panda configuration file. Additionally, set want-tk true in order to enable the Direct Session Panel. More information about this configuration file is available in the Configuring Panda <configuring-panda3d> section.\n\nIf you want to quickly enable the Direct Session browser, add the following code before importing DirectStart:\n\nfrom panda3d.core import loadPrcFileData\nloadPrcFileData(\"\", \"want-directtools #t\")\nloadPrcFileData(\"\", \"want-tk #t\")",
