  "content": "This chunk appears to be part of a class responsible for managing object manipulation handles or gizmos in a 3D scene. The `growToFit` method dynamically scales the handles based on their position relative to the camera and the viewport dimensions, ensuring they remain appropriately sized for interaction regardless of the viewer's perspective. This functionality is likely used in a 3D modeling or game development context where precise object manipulation is essential.\n\ndef growToFit(self):\n        # Increase handles scale until they cover 30% of the min dimension\n        pos = ShowBaseGlobal.direct.widget.getPos(ShowBaseGlobal.direct.camera)\n        minDim = min(ShowBaseGlobal.direct.dr.nearWidth, ShowBaseGlobal.direct.dr.nearHeight)\n        sf = 0.15 * minDim * (pos[1]/ShowBaseGlobal.direct.dr.near)\n        self.ohScalingFactor = sf\n        sf = sf * self.directScalingFactor\n        ival = self.scalingNode.scaleInterval(0.5, (sf, sf, sf),\n                                              blendType = 'easeInOut',\n                                              name = 'resizeObjectHandles')\n        ival.start()",
