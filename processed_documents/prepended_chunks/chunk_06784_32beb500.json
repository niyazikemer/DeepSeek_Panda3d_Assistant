(This appears to be buggy on some\ndrivers.) gl-support-sampler-objects bool 1 Setting this allows Panda to make use of sampler objects. Set to\nfalse if you suspect a bug in the driver implementation. gl-support-shadow-filter bool 1 Disable this if you suspect a bug in the driver implementation of\nARB_shadow. Particularly, older ATI cards suffered from a broken\nimplementation of the shadow map filtering features. gl-support-texture-lod bool 1 Configure this true to enable the use of minmax LOD settings and\ntexture LOD bias settings. Set this to false if you suspect a driver\nbug. gl-use-bindless-texture bool 0 Set this to let Panda use OpenGL's bindless texture extension for\nall textures passed to shaders, for improved performance. This is an\nexperimental feature and comes with a few caveats; for one, it requires\nthat all sampler uniforms have a layout(bindless_sampler) qualifier, and\nit also requires that the texture properties are not modified after the",
