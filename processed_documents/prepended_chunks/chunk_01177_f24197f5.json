  "content": "This code chunk appears to be part of an animation or spline curve editing system, likely within a graphical application. The context involves resetting the state of pre and post points used in defining curves, followed by merging these points and computing new curves based on the updated data. This process is typically triggered when starting fresh or modifying existing animations/curves.\n\n**Context:** Code for handling animation curve computation after point reset and merge operations.\n\nself.mergePoints()\n                # Clear out pre and post list\n                self.prePoints = []\n                self.postPoints = []\n                # Reset recording mode\n                self.setNewCurveMode()\n            # Compute curve\n            self.computeCurves()",
