  "content": "This code chunk is part of a method that handles node path selection in Direct3D, likely updating tracking variables and cluster servers when an object is selected. It updates the `last` variable to track the most recently selected node path and informs cluster servers if in client mode.\n\nContext: The code is within a method responsible for selecting objects (e.g., via mouse clicks) in a 3D scene, ensuring the selection is tracked globally and propagated across distributed systems when applicable.\n\n# And update last\n        __builtins__[\"last\"] = self.last = dnp\n        # Update cluster servers if this is a cluster client\n        if base.direct.clusterMode == 'client':\n            cluster.selectNodePath(dnp)\n        return dnp",
