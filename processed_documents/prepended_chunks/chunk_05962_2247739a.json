  "content": "The chunk is situated within a section of the document discussing storage and typesetting conventions for matrices. It explains how different terms like \"row-major\" and \"column-major\" relate to both storage order and typesetting format, highlighting their potential confusion due to independence between these aspects. This context is part of a broader discussion on matrix handling in Panda, OpenGL, and DirectX, focusing on storage order and manual notation differences.\n\nStore derivatives of xo first, typeset in row-vector-compatible notation.\n\nStore derivatives of xo first, typeset in column-vector-compatible notation.\n\nStore derivatives wrt xi first, typeset in row-vector-compatible notation.\n\nStore derivatives wrt xi first, typeset in column-vector-compatible notation.\n\nThe Terms \"Column Major\" and \"Row Major\"\n\nThe term \"row-major\" means \"the first four coefficients that you store, are also the first row when you typeset.\" So the four possibilities break down like this:\n\nStore derivatives of xo first, typeset in row-vector-compatible notation (COLUMN MAJOR)\n\nStore derivatives of xo first, typeset in column-vector-compatible notation (ROW MAJOR)\n\nStore derivatives wrt xi first, typeset in row-vector-compatible notation (ROW MAJOR)\n\nStore derivatives wrt xi first, typeset in column-vector-compatible notation (COLUMN MAJOR)",
