  "content": "This chunk is part of a class definition for a DirectGUI element in a Python application framework. The code is managing the construction and initialization of a megawidget (a complex GUI component composed of multiple sub-components). \n\nThe chunk introduces:\n1. `__componentAliases`: A dictionary mapping alias names to component or sub-component names, allowing easier reference to parts of the widget.\n2. `_constructorKeywords`: A dictionary tracking keywords provided during object construction, including their values and usage status (whether they've been applied to components).\n\nThis is occurring in a context where:\n- The class is initializing GUI properties and configurations\n- It follows setup of basic attributes like position and scale\n- It precedes the setup of hooks for component interaction\n\nThe code ensures proper initialization by tracking how constructor arguments are used, preventing unused options from being silently ignored.\n\n# Mapping from alias names to the names of components or\n        # sub-components.\n        self.__componentAliases = {}\n\n        # Contains information about the keywords provided to the\n        # constructor.  It is a mapping from the keyword to a tuple\n        # containing:\n        #    - value of keyword\n        #    - a boolean indicating if the keyword has been used.\n        # A keyword is used if, during the construction of a megawidget,\n        #    - it is defined in a call to defineoptions() or addoptions(), or\n        #    - it references, by name, a component of the megawidget, or\n        #    - it references, by group, at least one component\n        # At the end of megawidget construction, a call is made to\n        # initialiseoptions() which reports an error if there are\n        # unused options given to the constructor.\n        #\n        # self._constructorKeywords = {}",
