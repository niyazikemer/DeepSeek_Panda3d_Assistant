  "content": "The chunk provides an overview of PandAI's flocking system, detailing how to create a flock by specifying parameters such as visibility cone angles, radius, and weights for separation, cohesion, and alignment. It includes examples of standard flock configurations (Normal, Loose, Tight) to help users customize their flocks effectively.\n\nContext: The chunk introduces the fundamentals of setting up and customizing a flock using PandAI's system, explaining key parameters and offering predefined configurations to guide implementation.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkfnlqH06IY\n\nUsing PandAI's flocking system:\n\n// To create the flock\nflockObject = Flock(unsigned int flock_id, double vcone_angle,\n                    double vcone_radius, unsigned int cohesion_wt,\n                    unsigned int separation_wt, unsigned int alignment_wt)\n\n\"flock_id\" is a value identifying the flock.\n\n\"vcone_angle\" is the visibility angle of the character (represented by a cone around it)\n\n\"vcone_radius\" is the length of the visibility cone.\n\n\"cohesion_wt\", \"separation_wt\" and \"alignment_wt\" is the amount of separation force that contributes to the overall flocking behavior.\n\nSome standard values to start you off with:\n\nType vcone_angle vcone_radius separation_wt cohesion_wt alignment_wt\n\nNormal Pack 270 10 2 4 1\n\nLoose Pack 180 10 2 4 5\n\nTight Pack 45 5 2 4 5\n\nYou could try experimenting with your own values to customize your flock.\n\nTo add your AI Character to the above created flock",
