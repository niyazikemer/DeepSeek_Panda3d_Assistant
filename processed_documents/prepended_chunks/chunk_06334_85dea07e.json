  "content": "The chunk introduces two new questions regarding file types: understanding .pz files in samples and the creation of .pyc files by Python. These should be situated under a new section titled \"File Types\" within the \"Frequently Asked Questions\" to group related topics together, enhancing searchability and navigation for users seeking information on these specific file formats.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat are the .pz files I am seeing in the samples?\n\nThose are files that are zipped with pzip. Along with punzip, these command-line tools handle compression of files in a format that Panda3D can read; pzip for compressing and punzip for decompressing. Usage:\n\npzip file [file2 file3 ...]\npzip -o dest_file file\n\nUsage:\n\npunzip file.pz [file2.pz file3.pz ...]\npunzip -o dest_file file.pz\n\nWhat are the .pyc files that are created after I run the Python interpreter?",
