  "content": "The provided code chunk consists of two methods: `disableMouseEvents` and an `inputHandler`. These should be integrated into the `DisplayRegionManager` class to handle mouse event management and input processing, especially in multi-view setups. \n\n**Contextual Fit Explanation:**\n- **disableMouseEvents**: This method is intended to stop handling specific mouse events by ignoring them across all registered display regions.\n- **inputHandler**: Manages incoming mouse inputs, ensuring correct handling in multi-window environments and addressing orphaned events.\n\nThese methods enhance the manager's ability to control event propagation and manage user interactions efficiently. They should be added within the `DisplayRegionManager` class to maintain a cohesive structure for handling user input across multiple display regions.\n\n**Placement:**\nInsert these methods into the `DisplayRegionManager` class, possibly after existing mouse-related functions like `mouseUpdate`, to keep related functionalities grouped.\n\n**Docstring Update:**\nAdd docstrings explaining each method's purpose and parameters to improve code clarity.\n\n```python\n    def disableMouseEvents(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Disables all registered mouse events by ignoring them.\n        \"\"\"\n        for event in self.mouseEvents:\n            self.ignore(event)\n\n    def inputHandler(self, input):\n        \"\"\"\n        Handles input processing, especially in multi-view setups, addressing orphaned events and ensuring proper event handling.\n        \n        Args:\n            input: The input event to process.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not hasattr(self, 'oobeMode') or self.oobeMode == 0:\n            # Handling for multi-view scenarios\n            if self.manipulationControl.fMultiView:\n                # Check for orphaned events and handle accordingly\n                if (self.fMouse1 and 'mouse1' not in input or\n                    self.fMouse2 and 'mouse2' not in input or\n                    self.fMouse3 and 'mouse3' not in input):\n                    if input.endswith('-up') or input not in self.modifierEvents:\n                        return  # Ignore orphaned events\n```\n\nThis integration streamlines mouse event management within the `DisplayRegionManager`, ensuring robust handling across multiple windows.\n\ndef disableMouseEvents(self):\n        for event in self.mouseEvents:\n            self.ignore(event)\n\n    def inputHandler(self, input):\n        if not hasattr(self, 'oobeMode') or self.oobeMode == 0:\n            # [gjeon] change current camera dr, iRay, mouseWatcher accordingly to support multiple windows\n            if self.manipulationControl.fMultiView:\n                # handling orphan events\n                if self.fMouse1 and 'mouse1' not in input or\\\n                   self.fMouse2 and 'mouse2' not in input or\\\n                   self.fMouse3 and 'mouse3' not in input:\n                    if input.endswith('-up') or\\\n                       input not in self.modifierEvents:\n                        # to handle orphan events\n                        return",
