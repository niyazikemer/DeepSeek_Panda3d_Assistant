  "content": "The provided text is part of a comprehensive guide explaining how materials define an object's visual appearance under various lighting conditions in Panda3D, including details about ambient, diffuse, and emission properties that contribute to the object's color and shading.\n\nProperty Effects Setter Method Ambient This is the color of the object as it appears in the absence of\ndirect light. This will be multiplied by any ambient lights in effect on\nthe material to set its base color. material.set_ambient((R,G,B,A)) <.Material.set_ambient> Diffuse This is the primary color of an object; the color of the object as\nit appears in direct light, in the absence of highlights. This will be\nmultiplied by any lights in effect on the material to get the color in\nthe parts of the object illuminated by the lights. material.set_diffuse((R,G,B,A)) <.Material.set_diffuse> Emission This is the color of the object as it appears in the absence of any\nlight whatsoever, including ambient light. It is as if the object is\nglowing by this color (although of course it will not illuminate\nneighboring objects) material.set_emission((R,G,B,A)) <.Material.set_emission> Shininess This controls the size of the specular highlight spot.
