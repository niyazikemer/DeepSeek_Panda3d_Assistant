  "content": "The `xlateCamXZ` method is part of an object manipulation system designed for 3D environments, specifically handling constrained 2D motion parallel to the camera's image plane. This method allows objects to be translated in the XZ plane relative to the camera view and manages widget positioning and user input scaling based on distance from the camera.\n\n### FREE MANIPULATION METHODS ###\n    def xlateCamXZ(self, state):\n        \"\"\"Constrained 2D motion parallel to the camera's image plane\n        This moves the object in the camera's XZ plane\"\"\"\n        # reset fHitInit in case we later switch to manip mode\n        self.fHitInit = 1\n        # Reset scaling init flag\n        self.fScaleInit = 1\n        # Where is the widget relative to current camera view\n        vWidget2Camera = ShowBaseGlobal.direct.widget.getPos(ShowBaseGlobal.direct.camera)\n        x = vWidget2Camera[0]\n        y = vWidget2Camera[1]\n        z = vWidget2Camera[2]\n        # Move widget (and objects) based upon mouse motion\n        # Scaled up accordingly based upon widget distance\n        dr = ShowBaseGlobal.direct.dr",
