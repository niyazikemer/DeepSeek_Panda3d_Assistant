  "content": "The chunk is part of a section discussing \"Known Issues\" related to using Panda3D's exporter for animated models and static geometry in 3ds Max, highlighting specific export options and user misconceptions.\n\nKnown Issues\n\nCurrently, you have to use the option 'Export Entire Scene' when having animated models, otherwise the character hierarchy might not be exported correctly.\n\nUser interpretation regarding \"Pose\" versus the other export types (\"Model\", \"Animation\", \"Both\") was not always correct. Newer versions of the exporter will have \"Static\" rather than \"Pose\" in the interface, as the \"Static\" (formerly listed as \"Pose\") type should be chosen for exporting an environment or static geometry, with the \"Model\" type chosen for exporting an animatable model with joints and vertex membership. Using \"Static\" will generate an egg file without a \"Dart\" tag. The \"Model\" export will produce a \"Dart\" tag in the egg file. See egg-syntax for more details.",
