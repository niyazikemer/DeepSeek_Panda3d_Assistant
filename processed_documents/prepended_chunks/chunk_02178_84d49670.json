  "content": "The chunk is from the initial docstring of the `pfreeze.py` script, which explains its purpose, functionality, and usage. This includes details about generating standalone executables, using `FreezeTool.py`, and the options available for output formats like executables, multifiles, or shared libraries. The context sits at the beginning of the document, providing an overview of the script's capabilities and how it leverages Python's tools to freeze code into standalone applications.\n\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n\n\"\"\"\n\nThis script can be used to produce a standalone executable from\narbitrary Python code.  You supply the name of the starting Python\nfile to import, and this script attempts to generate an executable\nthat will produce the same results as \"python startfile.py\".\n\nThis script is actually a wrapper around Panda's FreezeTool.py, which\nis itself a tool to use Python's built-in \"freeze\" utility to compile\nPython code into a standalone executable.  It also uses Python's\nbuilt-in modulefinder module, which it uses to find all of the modules\nimported directly or indirectly by the original startfile.py.\n\nUsage::\n\n  pfreeze.py [opts] [startfile]\n\nOptions::\n\n  -o output\n     Specifies the name of the resulting executable file to produce.\n     If this ends in \".mf\", a multifile is written instead of a frozen\n     binary.  If it ends in \".dll\", \".pyd\", or \".so\", a shared library\n     is written.",
