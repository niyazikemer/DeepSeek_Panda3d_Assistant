It limits the total amount of graphics memory, including texture\nmemory and vertex buffer memory, that will be consumed by the GSG,\nregardless of whether the hardware claims to provide more graphics\nmemory than this. It is useful to put a ceiling on graphics memory\nconsumed, since some drivers seem to allow the application to consume\nmore memory than the hardware can realistically support. Set this to -1\nto have no limit other than the normal hardware-imposed limit. handle-datagrams-internally bool 1 When this is true, certain datagram types can be handled directly by\nthe C++ cConnectionRepository implementation, for performance reasons.\nWhen it is false, all datagrams are handled by the Python\nimplementation. hardware-animated-vertices bool #f (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded Set this true to allow the transforming of soft-skinned animated",
