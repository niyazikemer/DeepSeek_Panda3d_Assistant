  "content": "The chunk appears in a section of the document discussing depth buffer functionality in Panda3D. The previous content explains how to enable or disable depth-write and depth-test for node paths, while this chunk transitions into altering the depth buffer's behavior by setting specific attributes, such as using DepthTestAttrib with various modes like MNone, MNever, MLess, etc., which is useful for advanced rendering scenarios.\n\nOne can remove these settings using ~.NodePath.clear_depth_test() and ~.NodePath.clear_depth_write().\n\nAltering the Depth Buffer\n\nOccasionally, it is desirable to alter the functionality of the depth buffer. Normally, the depth buffer only renders things that are in front, but it can be made to render things that are in back, or equal. This is rarely used, but it can be important for certain unusual algorithms like shadow volumes.\n\nTo do this, you need to use the .DepthTestAttrib directly, in one of the following variants:\n\npython",
