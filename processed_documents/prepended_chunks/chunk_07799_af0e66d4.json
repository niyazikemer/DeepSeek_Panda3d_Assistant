  "content": "The chunk provides an overview of essential third-party libraries that Panda3D relies on for core functionalities such as scripting (Python), compression (ZLib), and image handling (libjpeg and libpng). These libraries are recommended for optimal performance, but their omission will disable specific features in Panda3D.\n\nHere you have a list of all third party libraries Panda3D must or can be compiled against. All of them are optional, but some features of Panda3D depend on certain libraries being available; omitting certain libraries will omit the corresponding features from Panda3D.\n\nRecommended Libraries\n\nPython\n\nhttps://www.python.org/\n\nPanda3D is way easier and faster to code with when using Python bindings.\n\nLicense: PSF license\n\nZLib\n\nhttps://www.zlib.net/\n\nUsed for a range of compression and decompression tasks, particularly .pz files.\n\nLicense: zlib license\n\nlibjpeg\n\nhttps://www.ijg.org/\n\nJPEG library. Required to read and save JPEG files. As of Panda 1.10, Panda3D will fall back to stb_image for loading .jpg files when building without libjpeg, but this may not support all JPEG features.\n\nLicense: libjpeg license\n\nlibpng\n\nhttp://www.libpng.org",
