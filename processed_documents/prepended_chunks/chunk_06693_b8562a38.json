  "content": "This chunk provides instructions for running a Panda3D sample program called \"Procedural Cube,\" which demonstrates creating a 3D cube model in minimal lines of code, with platform-specific details for Windows and Linux users.\n\nSample Programs: Procedural Cube\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nThis program synthesizes a 3D model of a cube. If you need to see in the minimum number of lines of code how to synthesize a model, this is the sample you want.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
