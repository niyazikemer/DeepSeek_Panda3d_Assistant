  "content": "This is a Python class `CachedDOData` that serves as a base class for objects storing data in the CRDataCache. It manages cached data between DistributedObject instantiations by implementing initialization (`__init__`), destruction (`destroy`), and flushing of cached data (`flush`). The class also includes special methods (`__getattribute__`) to allow arbitrary attributes, facilitating flexible attribute handling for type checking with mypy.\n\nclass CachedDOData:\n    # base class for objects that are used to store data in the CRDataCache\n    #\n    # stores a minimal set of cached data for DistributedObjects between instantiations\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        # override and store cached data\n        # this object now owns the data\n        # ownership will either pass back to another instantion of the object,\n        # or the data will be flushed\n        pass\n\n    def destroy(self):\n        # override and handle this object being destroyed\n        # this is destruction of this object, not the cached data (see flush)\n        pass\n\n    def flush(self):\n        # override and destroy the cached data\n        # cached data is typically created by the DistributedObject and destroyed here\n        pass\n\n    # These next two methods tell mypy to allow arbitrary attributes.\n    def __getattribute__(self, name: str):\n        return object.__getattribute__(self, name)",
