  "content": "The note about `getFullFrame()` and `getFullFframe()` appears within a section discussing the animation control methods available for multi-part actors in Panda3D. Specifically, it provides important clarification regarding the behavior of these frame-counting functions during animations, emphasizing that their returned values can exceed the total number of frames while looping or playing animations.\n\n# Note: the numbers returned by getFullFrame and getFullFframe keep counting\n# and may exceed the total number of frames.",
