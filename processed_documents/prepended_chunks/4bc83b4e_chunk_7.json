  "content": "The provided code chunk sets up the initial 3D environment and obstacles in a virtual world using Panda3D. It creates collision-optimized meshes for rendering and positioning, including environmental models and static obstacles like boxes. This section comes early in the document, likely within an `__init__` method or initialization setup, where core elements of the virtual scene are established before any AI behavior or character movement is implemented.\n\n# Set up the environment\n        #\n        # This environment model contains collision meshes.
