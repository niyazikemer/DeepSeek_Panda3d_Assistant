  "content": "The document discusses Bump Mapping sample programs in Panda3D, providing instructions on how to run them and explaining the concept of Normal Mapping as a technique to enhance surface realism through lighting effects.\n\nSample Programs: Bump Mapping\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nNormal Mapping is a technique to make textured surfaces appear more \"lifelike\" by having them respond to changing lights and viewing angles. As the light moves around, it reflects off of simulated \"bumps\" on the surface (the bumps are not real, the polygons are flat, but they look real because of how they reflect the light).\n\nPanda's built-in Normal Mapping Capabilities",
