  "content": "This chunk is part of a larger document discussing Python module management and dependencies. It defines an `ignoreImports` dictionary that specifies which module imports should be ignored to prevent unwanted dependencies. The context focuses on managing optional or unnecessary module imports, particularly for certain modules like 'pstats', 'profile', and others, while also handling version-specific exclusions in Python 3.8 and later.\n\n# These are modules that import other modules but shouldn't pick them up as\n# dependencies (usually because they are optional).  This prevents picking up\n# unwanted dependencies.\nignoreImports = {\n    'direct.showbase.PythonUtil': ['pstats', 'profile'],\n\n    'toml.encoder': ['numpy'],\n    'py._builtin': ['__builtin__'],\n\n    'site': ['android_log'],\n}\n\nif sys.version_info >= (3, 8):\n    # importlib.metadata is a \"provisional\" module introduced in Python 3.8 that\n    # conditionally pulls in dependency-rich packages like \"email\" and \"pep517\"\n    # (the latter of which is a thirdparty package!)  But it's only imported in\n    # one obscure corner, so we don't want to pull it in by default.\n    ignoreImports['importlib._bootstrap_external'] = ['importlib.metadata']\n    ignoreImports['importlib.metadata'] = ['pep517']",
