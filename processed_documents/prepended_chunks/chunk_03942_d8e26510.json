  "content": "This chunk is the introductory documentation of a Cg shader named BLOOM_I, which explains its functionality in converting RGB values to grayscale for brightness calculations and applying bloom effects with customizable desaturation levels. The comments describe how blend weights determine color conversion, desaturation controls bloom color intensity, and trigger parameters define bloom activation thresholds based on pixel brightness.\n\nBLOOM_I = \"\"\"\n//Cg\n//\n// blend.rgb\n//\n//   This shader converts to black-and-white before calculating\n//   scene brightness.  To do this, it uses a weighted average of\n//   R,G,B.  The blend parameter controls the weighting.\n//\n// desat.x\n//\n//   Desaturation level.
