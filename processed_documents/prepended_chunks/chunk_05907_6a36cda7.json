  "content": "The chunk appears after detailed explanations of individual lens properties (field of view, focal length, film size, etc.), providing an overview of how these properties interact and influence each other in determining the final lens configuration.\n\nInterplay of lens properties\n\nNote that, as mentioned above, several of these properties are interrelated. In particular, the field of view, focal length, and film size are closely tied together. Setting any two of these three properties will implicitly define the third one.\n\nPanda will let you set all three of these properties as often as you like, but only the last two properties you set will be important. That is, if you set field of view and film size, Panda will calculate the focal length. If you set film size and focal length, Panda will calculate the field of view. If you set focal length and field of view, Panda will calculate the film size.\n\nAlso, the aspect ratio can be set either implicitly, by using the two-parameter ~.Lens.set_fov() or ~.Lens.set_film_size() methods, or explicitly, by directly specifying it with ~.Lens.set_aspect_ratio(). If you set the aspect ratio explicitly, Panda will recompute your vertical field of view and vertical film size to match.",
