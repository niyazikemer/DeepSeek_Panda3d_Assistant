  "content": "This code chunk imports essential modules and classes required for implementing distance-based phase transition functionality. It sets up the necessary dependencies for defining the DistancePhasedNode class, including collision handling components from Panda3D's core libraries and inheritance from PhasedObject. The code is part of a module that implements node objects capable of transitioning between different states or phases based on their proximity to another object in a 3D environment, with support for buffered distances to prevent flickering issues.\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nfrom direct.showbase.DirectObject import DirectObject\nfrom direct.directnotify.DirectNotifyGlobal import directNotify\nfrom panda3d.core import (\n    BitMask32,\n    CollisionHandlerEvent,\n    CollisionNode,\n    CollisionSphere,\n    CollisionTraverser,\n    NodePath,\n)\nfrom .PhasedObject import PhasedObject",
