  "content": "This section discusses the differences between C++ and Pythonic (direct) notifiers in Panda's logging system. It highlights how to distinguish them by category names, configuration options for each type, and notes that Python notifiers lack spam and fatal levels.\n\npython\n\nNote\n\nThere are two kinds of notifiers: the C++ one and a Pythonic (therefore 'direct'notify). You can distinguish them by the category name. Where C++ categories are always lowercase, Python categories are starting with a capital letter by convention (e.g. util, and ShowBase). The only differences in practice is that you set (all) Python notifiers with the prc option default-notify-level and C++ with notify-level, and Pythonic notifiers don't know the spam and fatal levels.\n\nSometimes it is interesting and educational to change the configuration to this:\n\nnotify-level spam\ndefault-directnotify-level info",
