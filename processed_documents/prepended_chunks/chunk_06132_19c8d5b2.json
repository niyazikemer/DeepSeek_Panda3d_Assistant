  "content": "This chunk is situated within a discussion about gamma correction and color space management in Panda3D. It specifically addresses the sRGB Encode Filter and its role in proper rendering by converting colors into linear space for accurate lighting calculations, while advising against using gamma adjustment for monitor calibration purposes.\n\nDo not use this to adjust to the 2.2 gamma of a computer monitor. For that, see the below filter.\n\nfilters.setGammaAdjust(1.5)\nfilters.delGammaAdjust()\n\nThe sRGB Encode Filter\n\nThis filter applies the inverse sRGB Electro-Optical Transfer Function (EOTF) to the final rendering result. This allows the lighting and blending calculations to be performed in linear space, which results in more accurate colors and lighting.\n\nThe effect of this is similar to applying a gamma adjustment of 1.0/2.2, but not quite. The sRGB transfer function has a linear section in the beginning to better preserve the fidelity of dark values.\n\nWhen enabling this, it is important to make sure that all color input textures are properly configured to use the sRGB format, to prevent them from appearing too bright and washed-out.",
