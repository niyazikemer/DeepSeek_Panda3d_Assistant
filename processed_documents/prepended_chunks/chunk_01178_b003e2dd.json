This method records raw data points by calculating elapsed time since the start of recording and invoking `self.recordPoint(time)`, fitting into a larger system that likely includes data logging or animation capture functionalities.\n\ndef recordTask(self, state):\n        # Record raw data point\n        time = self.recordStart + (\n            ClockObject.getGlobalClock().getFrameTime() - state.startTime)\n        self.recordPoint(time)\n        return Task.cont",
