  "content": "The provided chunk is part of the `DirectStart` module in Panda3D, which serves as a deprecated shortcut for initializing the `ShowBase` class. The code demonstrates how to set up a graphical window and scene graph using this interface while advising against its use in production applications due to its deprecation since Panda3D 1.9.\n\n\"\"\"\nThis is a shortcut that instantiates ShowBase automatically on import,\nopening a graphical window and setting up the scene graph.\nThis example demonstrates its use:\n\n   import direct.directbase.DirectStart\n   base.run()\n\nWhile it may be considered useful for quick prototyping in the interactive\nPython shell, using it in applications is not considered good style.\nAs such, it has been deprecated starting with Panda3D 1.9.  It is equivalent\nto and may be replaced by the following code:\n\n   from direct.showbase.ShowBase import ShowBase\n   base = ShowBase()\n\"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ()\n\nif __debug__:\n    print('Using deprecated DirectStart interface.')\n\nfrom direct.showbase import ShowBase\nbase = ShowBase.ShowBase()",
