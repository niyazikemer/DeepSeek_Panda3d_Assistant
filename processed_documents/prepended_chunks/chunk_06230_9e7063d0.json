  "content": "This chunk discusses a shortcut method in Panda3D for loading textures as models, which automatically creates a textured card, situated within a broader discussion on applying textures to 2D or 3D scenes.\n\ncpp\n\nAs a special shortcut, you can also directly load the texture as though it were a model, which will automatically create a card for it:\n\nNodePath card;\ncard = window->load_model(window->get_render(), \"maps/noise.rgb\");\n\nThis short piece of code will result in a single polygon in the scene with the noise texture applied to it. Of course, if you need it in the 2-D scene, you should use ~WindowFramework::get_aspect2d() or ~WindowFramework::get_render2d() instead of ~WindowFramework::get_render().",
