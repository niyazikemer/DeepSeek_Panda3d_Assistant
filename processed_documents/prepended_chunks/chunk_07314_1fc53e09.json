  "content": "This chunk explains how Panda generates log messages for debugging, including their structure (module name and severity level), the severity hierarchy from fatal to spam, and how the panda configuration file controls message visibility by specifying thresholds in Config.prc (e.g., notify- and default-directnotify-level settings).\n\nLog Messages\n\nPanda periodically outputs log messages for debugging purposes. A typical log message might look like this:\n\n:util(warning): Adjusting global clock's real time by -3.3 seconds.\n\nThe first part of the message, util, is the name of the module that generated the message. The second part, warning, indicates the severity. The severity levels are, in decreasing order: fatal, error, warning, info, debug, and spam. The panda configuration file (Config.prc) contains these directives:\n\nnotify-level warning\ndefault-directnotify-level warning\n\nDirectives like these tell panda which messages to show, and which to suppress. In the default configuration (shown above), all messages whose severity is warning or above are shown, all messages whose severity is less are suppressed.\n\npython\n\nNote",
