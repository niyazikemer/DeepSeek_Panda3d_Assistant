  "content": "The context is within a section explaining how to visualize and debug physical objects using Panda3D and Bullet Physics.\n\nBullet Debug Renderer\n\nIn the previous \"hello world\" sample we have been introduced to a few Bullet physics objects, for example the rigid body (.BulletRigidBodyNode) or box and plane collision shapes (.BulletPlaneShape, .BulletBoxShape).\n\nThese objects are part of the Panda3D scene graph. But they are not visible. In order to be able to actually see a rigid body we had to reparent a visible geometry below the rigid body node. This is fine, since we (1) can control the way an object looks like, by choosing whatever visible geometry we want, and (2) we can create invisible objects too, by not reparenting any geometry below a rigid body.\n\nBut when developing a game it sometimes would be handy to actually see where the physical objects are. This is what the .BulletDebugNode is for. It's not meant for users playing the game, but as an aid in finding problems while developing the game.",
