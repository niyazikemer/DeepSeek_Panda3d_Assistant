  "content": "The chunk provides an introduction to using Sequences and Parallels in Direct, explaining their purpose, creation syntax, modification via the append method, combination for complex control flow, and integration with wait intervals for delays.\n\nSequences and Parallels\n\nYou will need to have this import statement to use Sequences and Parallels.\n\nfrom direct.interval.IntervalGlobal import *\n\nSequences and Parallels can control when intervals are played. Sequences play intervals one after the other, effectively a \u201cdo in order\u201d command. Parallels are a \u201cdo together,\u201d playing all intervals at the same time. Both have simple formats, and every kind of interval may be used.\n\nmySequence = Sequence(myInterval1, ..., myIntervaln, name=\"Sequence Name\")\nmyParallel = Parallel(myInterval1, ..., myIntervaln, name=\"Parallel Name\")\n\nTo add to sequences or parallels after creating them, use the append method.\n\nmySequence.append(myInterval)\nmyParallel.append(myInterval)\n\nSequences and Parallels may also be combined for even greater control. Also, there is a wait interval that can add a delay to Sequences. While it can be defined beforehand, it does not have to be.",
