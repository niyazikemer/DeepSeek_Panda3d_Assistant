  "content": "The default lens in Panda3D is typically a perspective lens (an instance of .PerspectiveLens), which mimics real-world camera behavior. This section introduces how a perspective lens captures a 3D scene by defining a visible area (the frustum) and provides an illustration to visualize this process, setting the foundation for understanding other lens properties discussed later in the document.\n\nThis default lens will almost always be a perspective lens--that is, an instance of the class .PerspectiveLens--unless you have done something to change it to another kind of lens. A perspective lens is by far the most common kind of lens used, and it behaves the same way the physical lens in a camera works, or for that matter the same way the lenses in our eyes work:\n\nThe illustration above shows a camera with an ordinary perspective lens observing a model in the world. The camera can only see the part of the world that falls within the black lines; this area is called the lens frustum.\n\nIn the picture, you can also see the image that the lens is capturing (and that image is shown upside-down, just as it would be in a real, physical camera). This image is just for the purposes of illustration; it isn't really part of a Panda3D camera. It is included to help show the relationship between a Panda3D lens and a real, physical lens.",
