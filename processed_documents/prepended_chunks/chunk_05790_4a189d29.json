  "content": "The chunk sits within a series of code blocks where functions are redefined as methods for the `CInterval` class using `Dtool_funcToMethod`, followed by their deletion to clean up the namespace. Specifically, this chunk attaches the `popupControls` function as a method of `CInterval` and then deletes it from the module's scope.\n\n**Context:** The code defines helper functions for interval controls, converts them into methods of `CInterval`, and cleans up by deleting each function after conversion to avoid namespace clutter. This specific chunk handles the `popupControls` function.\n\nDtool_funcToMethod(popupControls, CInterval)\ndel popupControls\n#####################################################################",
