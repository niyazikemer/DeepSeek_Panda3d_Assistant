  "content": "The chunk discusses performance issues in Panda3D, specifically addressing \"too-many-text-updates\" and \"Performance Issue: Too Many Pixel Shader Instructions.\" These topics are situated within a broader list of common performance problems, emphasizing resource-intensive tasks that can hinder rendering efficiency.\n\ntoo-many-text-updates. If you have lots of text in your game that gets updated every frame, it will often take a long time for Panda to keep regenerating the text. You need to minimize the amount of text to regenerate per frame.\n\nPerformance Issue: Too Many Pixel Shader Instructions <too-many-shader-instructions>. If you are using per-pixel lighting, or hand-written shaders, you need to be conscious of how long your shaders are. Adding one pixel shader instruction can slow the video card a lot. Adding a texture lookup can slow it even more. Professional pixel shaders contain 20-30 assembly-level instructions.",
