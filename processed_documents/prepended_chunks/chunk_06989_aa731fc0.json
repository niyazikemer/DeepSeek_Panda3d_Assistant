  "content": "This chunk describes the keyboard and mouse-based camera control systems provided by the ShowBase class, explaining how each input method operates to move or rotate the camera. It is situated within a section detailing the various methods for controlling the camera in Panda3D applications.\n\nThe keyboard system uses the arrow keys. Up moves the camera forward, and down move it back. The left and right arrows turn the camera.\n\nThe mouse system responds whenever any button is held. If the pointer is towards the top of the screen, the camera moves forward. If it is towards the bottom, the camera moves backwards. If it is on either side, the camera rotates to that direction. The speed the camera moves is determined by how far from the center the mouse pointer is. Additionally, there is another command that allows control based on trackball mice.\n\nbase.useDrive()\nbase.useTrackball()",
