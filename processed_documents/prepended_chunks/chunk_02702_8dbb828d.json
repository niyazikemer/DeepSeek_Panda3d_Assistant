  "content": "The chunk provides an example demonstrating how to use the ToonEyes class from the SampleFSM module. This particular example illustrates how to create and interact with a state machine designed for controlling toon-style animations, specifically managing different eye states such as open, closed (blink), and surprised. The example shows transitioning between these states using specific requests like 'blink' and 'Surprised', and it also demonstrates the behavior of reverting to an open state after some time when running the application.\n\n####\n#### Example of using ToonEyes:\n##\n## >>> from ShowBaseGlobal import *\n## >>> import SampleFSM\n## >>> eyes = SampleFSM.ToonEyes()\n## swap in eyes open model\n## >>> eyes.request('blink')\n## swap in eyes closed model\n## ('Closed',)\n## >>> run()\n## swap in eyes open model\n## >>> eyes.request('Surprised')\n## swap in eyes surprised model\n## ('Surprised',)\n## >>> eyes.request('blink')\n## >>>",
