  "content": "The `createTextWidgets` method is part of a class that implements a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for inspecting objects and their attributes in real-time. This specific function sets up the text-based components of the interface, which include:\n\n1. A **text display area** (`self.textWidget`) that shows the current value or state of the selected attribute or object. This widget is read-only, as indicated by `text_state='disabled'`, and serves to present information to the user.\n\n2. A **command input area** (`self.commandWidget`), which acts as a console for evaluating Python commands. The initial text `'>>> '` suggests it's designed to mimic a Python interpreter prompt. Users can enter commands here, leveraging local variables like `object` (the current object being inspected) and `this` (the currently selected attribute or item).\n\nThe widgets are organized using Pmw's PanedWidget in vertical orientation, allowing the user to adjust their sizes interactively. The command input area is bound to the Return key, enabling command execution upon pressing Enter.\n\nThis setup is integral to an inspector tool that allows users not only to view but also to manipulate objects dynamically through Python commands.\n\ndef createTextWidgets(self):\n        textWidgetsFrame = self.framePane.add('textWidgets')\n        self.textPane = Pmw.PanedWidget(textWidgetsFrame, orient = tk.VERTICAL)\n        textFrame = self.textPane.add('text', size = 200)\n        self.textWidget = Pmw.ScrolledText(\n            textFrame, vscrollmode = 'static', text_state = 'disabled')\n        self.textWidget.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=1)\n        commandFrame = self.textPane.add('command')\n        self.commandWidget = Pmw.ScrolledText(\n            commandFrame, vscrollmode = 'static')\n        self.commandWidget.insert(1.0, '>>> ')\n        self.commandWidget.pack(fill = tk.BOTH, expand = 1)\n        self.commandWidget.component('text').bind(\n            '<KeyRelease-Return>', self.evalCommand)\n        self.textPane.pack(expand = 1, fill = tk.BOTH)",
