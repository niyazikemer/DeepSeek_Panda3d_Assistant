  "content": "The document discusses the importance of physics engines in providing realistic object interactions beyond basic collision detection. It explains that while Panda3D includes a built-in physics engine for simple simulations, advanced applications often require more robust solutions like Bullet or ODE, offering detailed comparisons and recommendations for selecting the appropriate engine based on project requirements.\n\n```<context>\nThe document provides an overview of physics engines in Panda3D, emphasizing the need for realistic dynamic interactions beyond collision detection. It details three options\u2014Panda's built-in engine, Bullet, and ODE\u2014comparing their features and recommending choices based on simulation complexity.\n</context>\n```\n\nPanda's Built-in Physics Engine <panda3d-physics-engine>: Panda3D has a very basic physics engine built-in that may apply forces to classes. The physics engine can handle angular or linear forces, as well as viscosity.\n\nBullet Physics Engine <bullet>: This is a good choice for more advanced physics in most games.\n\nThe Open Dynamics Engine <ode>: This is another option provided as part of the Panda3D binaries, but does not support as many features as Bullet.\n\nWhen you have a very simple simulation, you will most likely want to use the built-in physics, which works with Panda's collision system. However, many applications that need physics simulations may find it inadequate, as the Bullet system is far more full-featured.\n\nbuiltin/index bullet/index ode/index",
