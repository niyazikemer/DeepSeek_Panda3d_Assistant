  "content": "The provided chunk is part of the \"cpp\" section in the overall document, which focuses on how to work with actors and animations using C++. This specific code demonstrates loading an animation file into an actor model, binding the animations to the model for control, and provides examples of controlling the animations (looping, playing once, posing). It also includes a method to display loaded animation names and important notes about animation management in C++.\n\nThe code showcases the use of `load_model()` to load animations, `auto_bind()` to bind animations to the actor model, and various methods of `AnimControlCollection` for animation control. The section emphasizes key aspects such as not using PT or CPT with AnimControlCollection and the need to re-bind animations if additional ones are added post-initial binding.\n\nThis chunk is essential for developers implementing character animations in Panda3D using C++, providing practical examples of how to load, bind, and manage character animations effectively.\n\nLoad the Animation\n\nwindow->load_model(actor, \"panda-walk\");\n\nBind the Model and the Animation\n\n// don't use PT or CPT with AnimControlCollection\nAnimControlCollection anim_collection;\n\n//bind the animations to the model\nauto_bind(actor.node(), anim_collection);\n\nControl the Animations\n\n// the name of an animation is preceded in the .egg file with <Bundle>:\n// loop a specific animation\nanim_collection.loop(\"panda_soft\", true);\n\n// loop all animations\nanim_collection.loop_all(true);\n\n// play an animation once:\nanim_collection.play(\"panda_soft\");\n\n// pose\nanim_collection.pose(\"panda_soft\", 5);\n\nto display names of loaded animations you could use:\n\nfor (int n = 0; n < anim_controls.get_num_anims(); ++n) {\n  std::cerr << anim_controls.get_anim_name(n) << std::endl;\n}\n\nIf you add more animations to some node after calling: auto_bind(...) they will not be controllable until auto_bind(...) is called again with proper arguments.",
