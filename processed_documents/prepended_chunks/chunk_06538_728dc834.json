  "content": "This chunk sits within a comprehensive guide about the `Actor` class in Panda3D, focusing on its animation capabilities. The context introduces basic methods for controlling actor animations, providing foundational knowledge necessary for effectively using actors in 3D applications. It is positioned early in the document to establish core concepts before diving into more advanced topics like blending, subparts, and intervals.\n\nActor Animations\n\nSince the ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor class inherits from .NodePath, everything that can be done to a NodePath, such as ~.NodePath.reparent_to() and ~.NodePath.set_pos(), etc., may also be done to an Actor. In addition to the basic NodePath functionality, Actors have several additional methods to control animation. In order for Actors to animate, their pointer (variable) must be retained in memory. The following is only a brief introduction; see the API reference page for ~direct.actor.Actor for a complete list.\n\nBasic animation playing",
