It serves as a guide for advanced users seeking deeper control over model rendering and animation beyond standard practices.\n\nAdvanced operations with internal structures\n\nThe following pages provide descriptions of Panda's internal representation of vertices and the renderable geometry that uses them, as well as instructions for directly reading or manipulating this data.\n\nThis is an advanced topic of Panda3D and is not necessary for ordinary model rendering and animation, but the advanced user may find this information useful.\n\ngeometry-storage/index procedural-generation/index other-manipulation/index matrix-representation",
