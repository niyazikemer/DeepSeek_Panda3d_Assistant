  "content": "The chunk discusses frame rate management in Panda3D, emphasizing target frame rates (17-33 ms for 30-60 FPS) on mid-range hardware and the importance of video synchronization to prevent wasted processing. This is crucial for optimizing rendering performance and avoiding unnecessary resource usage.\n\nTo situate this within the document: The chunk falls under a section about managing frame rates and rendering efficiency, which is vital for performance optimization and preventing bugs that can degrade system performance. Understanding these concepts helps in identifying and mitigating bottlenecks effectively.\n\nUsually, games budget between 17 and 33 ms (resulting in 30 and 60 FPS respectively) on mid-range computer hardware, and add settings to decrease the quality of the game so that this frame rate can be attained on lower-end hardware as well. Increasing the frame rate to a number higher than 60 is not very useful, since most computer monitors refresh at this speed, and rendering faster than this would be a waste.\n\nIn fact, by default, Panda3D limits the frame rate to not exceed the monitor's refresh rate: this is called video synchronization, and besides ensuring that no processing power is wasted rendering frames that the monitor will not display, it also has the benefit of reduring some artifacts that can occur when the monitor refreshes halfway during a frame. This limit can be disabled to see the true frame rate by setting the config variable sync-video to false in the Config.prc <configuring-panda3d> file, although note that some drivers will override this setting.",
