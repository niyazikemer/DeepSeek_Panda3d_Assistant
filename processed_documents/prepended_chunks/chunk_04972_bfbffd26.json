  "content": "The chunk defines two methods related to mouse interaction in a 3D application: `setMouseOnNode`, which sets the node being controlled by mouse input, and `changeMouseInterface`, which switches between different camera control interfaces. These are part of a class handling window controls and camera setup, focusing on enabling user interaction through mouse-driven view manipulation (e.g., driving or trackball-style navigation).\n\ndef setMouseOnNode(self, newNode):\n        if self.mouse2cam:\n            self.mouse2cam.node().setNode(newNode)\n\n    def changeMouseInterface(self, changeTo):\n        \"\"\"\n        Change the mouse interface used to control the camera.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Get rid of the prior interface:\n        self.mouseInterface.detachNode()\n        # Update the mouseInterface to point to the drive\n        self.mouseInterface = changeTo\n        self.mouseInterfaceNode = self.mouseInterface.node()\n        # Hookup the drive to the camera.\n        if self.mouseWatcher:\n            self.mouseInterface.reparentTo(self.mouseWatcher)\n        if self.mouse2cam:\n            self.mouse2cam.reparentTo(self.mouseInterface)",
