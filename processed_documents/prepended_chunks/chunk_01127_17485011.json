  "content": "The chunk in question defines a series of event hooks and their corresponding handler methods. These events are related to node path selection and manipulation operations within the 3D scene viewer. The code snippet iterates over these event-handler pairs and registers each event with its associated method, enabling the application to respond appropriately to user interactions such as selecting or manipulating objects in the scene.\n\n**Succinct Context:**\nThis chunk defines event handlers for node path selection and manipulation events within a 3D scene viewer. These hooks allow the application to respond to user actions like object selection, deselection, and manipulation. The code registers these events with their respective handler methods, enabling interactive functionality in the viewer's camera window.\n\nThe context explains that this section is crucial for handling user interactions such as selecting or manipulating objects within the 3D scene displayed by the camera setup.\n\n('DIRECT_selectedNodePath', self.selectedNodePathHook),\n            ('DIRECT_deselectedNodePath', self.deselectedNodePathHook),\n            ('DIRECT_manipulateObjectStart', self.manipulateObjectStartHook),\n            ('DIRECT_manipulateObjectCleanup',\n             self.manipulateObjectCleanupHook),\n        ]\n        for event, method in self.actionEvents:\n            self.accept(event, method)",
