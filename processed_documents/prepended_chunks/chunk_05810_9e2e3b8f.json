  "content": "The chunk provides detailed information about creating BAM files manually using tools like egg2bam or NodePath.write_bam_file(), and highlights the importance of the Egg format as a text-based, unique file format in Panda3D.\n\nWith a few exceptions, most tools and plug-ins do not directly export to the BAM format. To create a BAM file manually, you can use a tool like egg2bam <converting-egg-to-bam>, or you can simply load or create the model in Panda3D and use the ~.NodePath.write_bam_file() method.\n\nEgg Format\n\nThe second-best-supported file format in Panda3D is the Egg format, a text-based format that is unique to Panda3D. There are many tools available to manipulate Egg files, and you can even open an Egg file in a text editor to see what it contains. See the egg-files section for more detailed information about this format.",
