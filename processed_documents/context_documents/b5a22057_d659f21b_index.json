  "content": "Inspection Tools\n\nThis section lists a number of tools to support programming in Panda.\n\nMany of the tools provided are invoked by pressing a hot-key inside of the Panda3D main window. These hot-key driven tools are called the \"direct tools.\" The direct tools are initially disabled, because the hot-keys used to invoke them might interfere with the program's own keys and events.\n\nTo enable the hot-keys for the direct tools, you need to set the want-directtools variable in config.prc, the main panda configuration file. Additionally, set want-tk true in order to enable the Direct Session Panel. More information about this configuration file is available in the Configuring Panda <configuring-panda3d> section.\n\nIf you want to quickly enable the Direct Session browser, add the following code before importing DirectStart:\n\nfrom panda3d.core import loadPrcFileData\nloadPrcFileData(\"\", \"want-directtools #t\")\nloadPrcFileData(\"\", \"want-tk #t\")\n\nAfter enabling direct tools and starting panda, the Direct Session window should appear:\n\nMany of these tools can also be launched by calling specific utility functions <inspection-utilities>.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nscene-graph-browser enhanced-mouse-navigation utility-functions",
