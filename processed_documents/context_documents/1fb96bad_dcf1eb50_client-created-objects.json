  "content": "Client-Side Created Objects\n\nAfter setting up a basic client and server and having them connect, the next step is to create some objects that will get distributed over this existing network connection.\n\nClient-side created DirectObjects are objects that the will be created using the .ClientRepository on the end users client.\n\nThere are multiple ways to create a DirectObject. You can either create an instance of a DO and pass it to the .ClientRepository.createDistributedObject call of the CR instance or simply pass its name.\n\nFor example, the following code creates a DGameObject which inherited from DistributedObject.\n\ndistributedObject = DGameObject()\ncr.createDistributedObject(\n    distObj = distributedObject,\n    zoneId = 2)\n\nThis example creates a DGameObject only from the name as defined in the DC definition files.\n\nself.gameDistObject = self.createDistributedObject(\n    className = 'DGameObject',\n    zoneId = 2)\n\nAs you have seen we\u2019ve set the zoneId to 2. This tells the object to live in this specific zone and all clients that have defined an interest in this zone with .ClientRepository.setInterestZones() will automatically \u201csee\u201d this object.\n\nFurther details about distributed objects and their usage will be shown in later sections.",
