  "content": "Sample Programs: Gamepad\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nThis sample program shows how to use game controller devices such as gamepads, steering wheels and joysticks in Panda3D. Gamepad devices are mostly used to control characters in games using input from specialized devices. In this example we will control the camera to steer around the environment with either a gamepad device, steering wheel or flightstick device.\n\nThe controls are as follows:\n\ngamepad:\n\nThis sample is for gamepads like for example the xbox, Switch Pro or Steam controller but will also work with all other gamepads that have any of those controls:\n\nMove Left thumbstick Move camera forward and strafe Move Right thumbstick Move camera heading and pitch Press Left thumbstick speed up strafe A/B/Y Show an onscreen text which button is pressed X Reset to start position Back/Start/Select Exit the sample program\n\nsteering wheel:\n\nAcceleration pedal Accelerate camera forward Break pedal Slow down camera Wheel Control cameras heading A Show an onscreen message Hat Up Re-Set the wheels center position\n\nflight stick:\n\nThrottle Accelerate camera forward Move Stick Control camera rotations Trigger Show an onscreen message\n\nFor more information on devices, please consult the joystick-support section of the manual.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
