If the input modelPath is a string (a single model\n        pathname), the return value will be a NodePath to the model\n        loaded if the load was successful, or None otherwise.  If the\n        input modelPath is a list of pathnames, the return value will\n        be a list of `.NodePath` objects and/or Nones.\n\n        loaderOptions may optionally be passed in to control details\n        about the way the model is searched and loaded.  See the\n        `.LoaderOptions` class for more.\n\n        The default is to look in the `.ModelPool` (RAM) cache first,\n        and return a copy from that if the model can be found there.\n        If the bam cache is enabled (via the `model-cache-dir` config\n        variable), then that will be consulted next, and if both\n        caches fail, the file will be loaded from disk.  If noCache is\n        True, then neither cache will be consulted or updated.\n\n        If allowInstance is True, a shared instance may be returned\n        from the `.ModelPool`.  This is dangerous, since it is easy to\n        accidentally modify the shared instance, and invalidate future\n        load attempts of the same model.  Normally, you should leave\n        allowInstance set to False, which will always return a unique\n        copy.\n\n        If okMissing is True, None is returned if the model is not\n        found or cannot be read, and no error message is printed.\n        Otherwise, an `IOError` is raised if the model is not found or\n        cannot be read (similar to attempting to open a nonexistent\n        file).  (If modelPath is a list of filenames, then `IOError`\n        is raised if *any* of the models could not be loaded.)\n\n        If callback is not None, then the model load will be performed\n        asynchronously.  In this case, loadModel() will initiate a\n        background load and return immediately.  The return value will\n        be an object that can be used to check the status, cancel the\n        request, or use it in an `await` expression.  Unless callback\n        is the special value True, when the requested model(s) have\n        finished loading, it will be invoked with the n\n        loaded models passed as its parameter list.  It is possible\n        that the callback will be invoked immediately, even before\n        loadModel() returns.  If you use callback, you may also\n        specify a priority, which specifies the relative importance\n        over this model over all of the other asynchronous load\n        requests (higher numbers are loaded first).\n\n        True asynchronous model loading requires Panda to have been\n        compiled with threading support enabled (you can test\n        `.Thread.isThreadingSupported()`).  In the absence of threading\n        support, the asynchronous interface still exists and still\n        behaves exactly as described, except that loadModel() might\n        not return immediately.\n\n        \"\"\"\n\n        assert Loader.notify.debug(\"Loading model: %s\" % (modelPath,))\n\n        if not self._loadedPythonFileTypes:\n            self._loadPythonFileTypes()\n\n        if loaderOptions is None:\n            loaderOptions = LoaderOptions()\n        else:\n            loaderOptions = LoaderOptions(loaderOptions)\n\n        if okMissing is not None:\n            if okMissing:\n                loaderOptions.setFlags(loaderOptions.getFlags() & ~LoaderOptions.LFReportErrors)\n            else:\n                loaderOptions.setFlags(loaderOptions.getFlags() | LoaderOptions.LFReportErrors)\n        else:\n            okMissing = ((loaderOptions.getFlags() & LoaderOptions.LFReportErrors) == 0)\n\n        if noCache is not None:\n            if noCache:\n                loaderOptions.setFlags(loaderOptions.getFlags() | LoaderOptions.LFNoCache)\n            else:\n                loaderOptions.setFlags(loaderOptions.getFlags() & ~LoaderOptions.LFNoCache)\n\n        if allowInstance:\n            loaderOptions.setFlags(loaderOptions.getFlags() | LoaderOptions.LFAllowInstance)\n\n        if not isinstance(modelPath, (tuple, list, set)):\n            # We were given a single model pathname.\n            modelList = [modelPath]\n            if phaseChecker:\n                phaseChecker(modelPath, loaderOptions)\n\n            gotList = False\n        else:\n            # Assume we were given a list of model pathnames.\n            modelList = modelPath\n            gotList = True\n\n        if blocking is None:\n            blocking = callback is None\n\n        if blocking:\n            # We got no callback, so it's a synchronous load.\n\n            result = []\n            for modelPath in modelList:\n                node = self.loader.loadSync(Filename(modelPath), loaderOptions)\n                if node is not None:\n                    nodePath = NodePath(node)\n                else:\n                    nodePath = None\n\n                result.append(nodePath)\n\n            if not okMissing and None in result:\n                message = 'Could not load model file(s): %s' % (modelList,)\n                raise IOError(message)\n\n            if gotList:\n                return result\n            else:\n                return result[0]\n\n        else:\n            # We got a callback, so we want an asynchronous (threaded)\n            # load.

A font file must be either a special\n        egg file (or bam file) generated with egg-mkfont, which is\n        considered a static font, or a standard font file (like a TTF\n        file) that is supported by FreeType, which is considered a\n        dynamic font.\n\n        okMissing should be True to indicate the method should return\n        None if the font file is not found.  If it is False, the\n        method will raise an exception if the font file is not found\n        or cannot be loaded.\n\n        Most font-customization parameters accepted by this method\n        (except lineHeight and spaceAdvance) may only be specified for\n        dynamic font files like TTF files, not for static egg files.\n\n        lineHeight specifies the vertical distance between consecutive\n        lines, in Panda units.  If unspecified, it is taken from the\n        font information.  This parameter may be specified for static\n        as well as dynamic fonts.\n\n        spaceAdvance specifies the width of a space character (ascii\n        32), in Panda units.  If unspecified, it is taken from the\n        font information.  This may be specified for static as well as\n        dynamic fonts.\n\n        The remaining parameters may only be specified for dynamic\n        fonts.\n\n        pixelsPerUnit controls the visual quality of the rendered text\n        characters.  It specifies the number of texture pixels per\n        each Panda unit of character height.  Increasing this number\n        increases the amount of detail that can be represented in the\n        characters, at the expense of texture memory.\n\n        scaleFactor also controls the visual quality of the rendered\n        text characters.  It is the amount by which the characters are\n        rendered bigger out of Freetype, and then downscaled to fit\n        within the texture.  Increasing this number may reduce some\n        artifacts of very small font characters, at a small cost of\n        processing time to generate the characters initially.\n\n        textureMargin specifies the number of pixels of the texture to\n        leave between adjacent characters.  It may be a floating-point\n        number.  This helps reduce bleed-through from nearby\n        characters within the texture space.  Increasing this number\n        reduces artifacts at the edges of the character cells\n        (especially for very small text scales), at the expense of\n        texture memory.\n\n        polyMargin specifies the amount of additional buffer to create\n        in the polygon that represents each character, in Panda units.\n        It is similar to textureMargin, but it controls the polygon\n        buffer, not the texture buffer.  Increasing this number\n        reduces artifacts from letters getting chopped off at the\n        edges (especially for very small text scales), with some\n        increasing risk of adjacent letters overlapping and obscuring\n        each other.\n\n        minFilter, magFilter, and anisotropicDegree specify the\n        texture filter modes that should be applied to the textures\n        that are created to hold the font characters.\n\n        If color is not None, it should be a VBase4 specifying the\n        foreground color of the font.  Specifying this option breaks\n        `TextNode.setColor()`, so you almost never want to use this\n        option; the default (white) is the most appropriate for a\n        font, as it allows text to have any arbitrary color assigned\n        at generation time.  However, if you want to use a colored\n        outline (below) with a different color for the interior, for\n        instance a yellow letter with a blue outline, then you need\n        this option, and then *all* text generated with this font will\n        have to be yellow and blue.\n\n        If outlineWidth is nonzero, an outline will be created at\n        runtime for the letters, and outlineWidth will be the desired\n        width of the outline, in points (most fonts are 10 points\n        high, so 0.5 is often a good choice).  If you specify\n        outlineWidth, you can also specify outlineFeather (0.0 .. 1.0)\n        and outlineColor.  You may need to increase pixelsPerUnit to\n        get the best results.\n\n        if renderMode is not None, it may be one of the following\n        symbols to specify a geometry-based font:\n\n            TextFont.RMTexture - this is the default.  Font characters\n              are rendered into a texture and applied to a polygon.\n              This gives the best general-purpose results.\n\n            TextFont.RMWireframe - Font characters are rendered as a\n              sequence of one-pixel lines.  Consider enabling line or\n              multisample antialiasing for best results.\n\n            TextFont.RMPolygon - Font characters are rendered as a\n              flat polygon.  This works best for very large\n              characters, and generally requires polygon or\n              multisample antialiasing to be enabled for best results.\n\n            TextFont.RMExtruded - Font characters are rendered with a\n              3-D outline made of polygons, like a cookie cutter.\n              This is appropriate for a 3-D scene, but may be\n              completely invisible when assigned to a 2-D scene and\n              viewed normally from the front, since polygons are\n              infinitely thin.\n\n            TextFont.RMSolid - A combination of RMPolygon and\n              RMExtruded: a flat polygon in front with a solid\n              three-dimensional edge.  This is best for letters that\n              will be tumbling in 3-D space.\n\n        If the texture mode is other than RMTexture, most of the above\n        parameters do not apply, though pixelsPerUnit still does apply\n        and roughly controls the tightness of the curve approximation\n        (and the number of vertices generated).\n\n        \"\"\"\n        assert Loader.notify.debug(\"Loading font: %s\" % (modelPath))\n        if phaseChecker:\n            loaderOptions = LoaderOptions()\n            if okMissing:\n                loaderOptions.setFlags(loaderOptions.getFlags() & ~LoaderOptions.LFReportErrors)\n            phaseChecker(modelPath, loaderOptions)\n\n        font = FontPool.loadFont(modelPath)\n        if font is None:\n            if not okMissing:\n                message = 'Could not load font file: %s' % (modelPath)\n                raise IOError(message)\n            # If we couldn't load the model, at least return an\n            # empty font.\n            font = StaticTextFont(PandaNode(\"empty\"))\n\n        # The following properties may only be set for dynamic fonts.\n        if hasattr(font, \"setPointSize\"):\n            if pointSize is not None:\n                font.setPointSize(pointSize)\n            if pixelsPerUnit is not None:\n                font.setPixelsPerUnit(pixelsPerUnit)\n            if scaleFactor is not None:\n                font.setScaleFactor(scaleFactor)\n            if textureMargin is not None:\n                font.setTextureMargin(textureMargin)\n            if polyMargin is not None:\n                font.setPolyMargin(polyMargin)\n            if minFilter is not None:\n                font.setMinfilter(minFilter)\n            if magFilter is not None:\n                font.setMagfilter(magFilter)\n            if anisotropicDegree is not None:\n                font.setAnisotropicDegree(anisotropicDegree)\n            if color:\n                font.setFg(color)\n                # This means we want the background to match the\n                # foreground color, but transparent.\n                font.setBg(VBase4(color[0], color[1], color[2], 0.0))\n            if outlineWidth:\n                font.setOutline(outlineColor, outlineWidth, outlineFeather)\n\n                # This means we want the background to match the\n                # outline color, but transparent.\n                font.setBg(VBase4(outlineColor[0], outlineColor[1], outlineColor[2], 0.0))\n            if renderMode:\n                font.setRenderMode(renderMode)\n\n        if lineHeight is not None:\n            # If the line height is specified, it overrides whatever\n            # the font itself thinks the line height should be.
