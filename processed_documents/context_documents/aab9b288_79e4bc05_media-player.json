If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nThis sample program shows how to play a movie in panda. This is particularly useful for cut-scenes, but movies can also be used as animated textures on the surfaces of objects. This sample shows both video and audio, and how to synchronize them properly.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
