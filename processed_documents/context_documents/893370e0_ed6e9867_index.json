  "content": "Sample Programs in the Distribution\n\nThe Panda3D Distribution includes quite a few sample programs. The following is a list of what's included, and which features of the engine each sample demonstrates. If you are just learning Panda3D, take a look at the ones marked as \"Beginner\" difficulty.\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install the Panda3D SDK. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d. On macOS, you'll find them in /Developer/Examples/Panda3D/ (or /Library/Developer/Examples/Panda3D as of Panda3D 1.10.5). Alternatively, you can download the samples separately from the download page.\n\nasteroids\n\nDifficulty: Advanced\n\nCreating tasks (routines that get called every frame)\n\nUsing 2D graphics\n\nball-in-maze\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nUsing the collision detector\n\nReading the mouse\n\nboxing-robots\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nLoading animated actors and playing animations\n\nbump-mapping\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate (or Advanced)\n\nEnables per-pixel lighting\n\nExplicit Shaders\n\ncarousel\n\nDifficulty: Beginner\n\nRelative positioning\n\nIntervals (automatic movement)\n\ncartoon-shader\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate (or Advanced)\n\nEnables per-pixel lighting\n\nExplicit Shaders\n\nImage Postprocessing\n\nRender-to-Texture\n\nchessboard\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nSelecting an object with the mouse\n\ndisco-lights\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nUsing vertex lighting\n\nEnables per-pixel lighting\n\ndistortion\n\nDifficulty: Advanced\n\nCreates an interesting shader effect where the entire screen is rendered into a texture.\n\nfireflies\n\nDifficulty: Very Advanced\n\nDeferred shading - a complex shader-based algorithm\n\nfractal-plants\n\nDifficulty: Very Advanced\n\nCreates a 3D model without loading it from disk\n\nglow-filter\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate (or Advanced)\n\nEnabling per-pixel lighting\n\nExplicit Shaders\n\nImage Postprocessing\n\nRender-to-Texture\n\ninfinite-tunnel\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nUsing fog to hide artifacts in the distance\n\nlooking-and-gripping\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nControlling a character's head procedurally\n\nCausing a character to grip an object\n\nmedia-player\n\nDifficulty: Beginner\n\nLoading a texture from an AVI file\n\nLoading a sound from an AVI file\n\nSynchronizing audio and video\n\nmotion-trails\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate (or Advanced)\n\nCreating a trail behind a moving object.\n\nCaptures contents of screen and reuses it later.\n\nmusic-box\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nPlaying sounds\n\nGUI buttons and sliders\n\nparticles\n\nDifficulty: Advanced\n\nDemonstrates the particle system\n\nprocedural-cube\n\nDifficulty: Advanced\n\nCreates a 3D model without loading it\n\nroaming-ralph\n\nDifficulty: Advanced\n\nA character walks around a terrain\n\nUses collision system to detect height of terrain\n\nshadows\n\nDifficulty: Advanced\n\nExplicit Shaders\n\nDynamic Shadows: shadow mapping\n\nsolar-system\n\nDifficulty: Beginner Tutorial\n\nTutorial structure shows development steps\n\nShows how objects can move relative to other objects\n\nrender-to-texture\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\n\nRender-to-texture\n\nPlaces rendered texture on model in scene\n\nasteroids ball-in-maze boxing-robots bump-mapping carousel cartoon-shader chessboard disco-lights distortion fireflies fractal-plants gamepad glow-filter infinite-tunnel looking-and-gripping media-player motion-trails mouse-modes music-box particles procedural-cube render-to-texture roaming-ralph shadows solar-system",
