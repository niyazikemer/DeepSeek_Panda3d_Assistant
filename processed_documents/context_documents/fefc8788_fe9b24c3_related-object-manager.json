  "content": "Related Object Manager\n\nThe Related Object Manager is a handy class that can be utilized to wait for the creation of multiple DOs. You simply pass the IDs of the objects you want to wait for as a list and a callback method. This callback method is called when all objects have been created successfully. This manager is readily available in repository-based classes like the Client Repository.\n\n# Use the client repositories manager\ncr.relatedObjectMgr.requestObjects(\n    [\n     playerDoId,\n     levelDoId,\n     someOtherObjectDoId\n    ],\n    allCallback = self.allObjectsManifested)\n\ndef allObjectsManifested(self, allObjects):\n    # allObjects now contains the DOs for the player, level\n    # and someOtherObject",
