  "content": "Setuptools Examples\n\nSimple Console Application\n\nThe most basic and simplest application to package is a simple console app with no dependencies:\n\nprint(\"Hello world\")\n\nAssuming this is saved as main.py, we can use the following requirements.txt file:\n\npanda3d\n\nThe corresponding setup.py file could look like so:\n\nimport setuptools\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"Hello World\",\n    options = {\n        'build_apps': {\n            'console_apps': {'hello_world': 'main.py'},\n        }\n    }\n)\n\nThen, we can build the binaries using python setup.py build_apps.\n\nA build directory will be created and contain a directory for each platform that binaries were built for. Since no platforms were specified, the defaults were used (manylinux1_x86_64, macosx_10_6_x86_64, win_amd64).\n\nNote, win32 is missing from the defaults. If a win32 build is desired, then platforms must be defined in setup.py and win_amd64 added to the list:\n\nimport setuptools\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"Hello World\",\n    options = {\n        'build_apps': {\n            'console_apps': {'hello_world': 'main.py'},\n            'platforms': [\n                'manylinux1_x86_64',\n                'macosx_10_6_x86_64',\n                'win_amd64',\n                'win32',\n            ],\n        }\n    }\n)\n\nAsteroids Sample\n\nBelow is an example of a setup.py that can be used to build the Asteroids sample program.\n\nfrom setuptools import setup\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"asteroids\",\n    options = {\n        'build_apps': {\n            'include_patterns': [\n                '**/*.png',\n                '**/*.jpg',\n                '**/*.egg',\n            ],\n            'gui_apps': {\n                'asteroids': 'main.py',\n            },\n            'plugins': [\n                'pandagl',\n                'p3openal_audio',\n            ],\n        }\n    }\n)\n\nWith the setup.py in place, it can be run with: python setup.py bdist_apps\n\nThe name field and options dictionary in the above setup.py can also be replaced by the following setup.cfg file:\n\n[metadata]\nname = asteroids\n\n[build_apps]\ninclude_patterns =\n    **/*.png\n    **/*.jpg\n    **/*.egg\ngui_apps =\n    asteroids = main.py\nplugins =\n    pandagl\n    p3openal_audio",
