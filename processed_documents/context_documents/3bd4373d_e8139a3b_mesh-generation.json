  "content": "Mesh Generation\n\nNavigation Mesh\n\nTo create a navigation mesh, you need a 3D software such as 3DS Max, Maya or Blender. Please follow the tutorial videos below to understand the process:\n\nStep 1:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACLuXWkpJhU\n\nStep 2:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rug0eYBa88M\n\nNote: There are separate versions of the mesh generation tool for \"Maya/Max\" users and \"Blender\" users. Make sure you download the correct version.\n\nMaya Users (IMPORTANT)\n\nSince the egg file produced by Maya uses a different format from 3DSMax, you will need to first convert them into the same format (triangles) by using the following command:\n\nC:\\Panda3D-|release|-x64\\bin\\egg-trans -C -o out.egg in.egg\n\nThe egg file that is thereby generated should be passed to the Mesh Generation Tool.\n\nBlender Users (IMPORTANT)\n\nCreation of the full and collision meshes is to be done on the x-y plane. This makes it much easier to just get in to Blender and create a mesh since the starting view is a top view of the x-y plane.\n\nNOTE : We advice to make meshes with a scale of 50 or above for best results. It would be wise to make your world based on this scale. Much smaller meshes bug out a bit.\n\nNOTE : To make faces on your plane mesh, use the subdivide utility in Blender in Edit Mode and to delete faces option when you enter Face Selection Mode while you are in Edit Mode.\n\nPLEASE NOTE : Download the mesh generators from here :\n\nMaya and Max :\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/etcpandai/download/meshgen_v1.0_exec.zip?attredirects=0&d=1\n\nBlender : (source also available in the Open Source section)\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/etcpandai/download/BlenderMeshGen.zip?attredirects=0&d=1",
