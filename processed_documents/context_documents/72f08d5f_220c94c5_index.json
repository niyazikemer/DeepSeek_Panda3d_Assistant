  "content": "Panda3D Physics Engine\n\nPanda3D has a very basic physics engine that may apply forces to classes. The physics engine can handle angular or linear forces, as well as viscosity. To make use of the physics engine, first enable the particle system. The particle system relies upon the physics engine to move and update particles, so enabling the particle system adds the tasks in the engine that monitor and update the interactions of physics-enabled objects in the scene.\n\nbase.enableParticles()\n\nThe rest of this section will address how to prepare a model for physical interactions and apply forces to the model.\n\nenabling-physics-on-a-node applying-physics-to-a-node types-of-forces notes-and-caveats",
