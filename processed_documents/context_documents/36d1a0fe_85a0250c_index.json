  "content": "Distributed Networking\n\nDistributed Networking is Panda3D's high-level network API. When a distributed object is created all interested clients will automatically create a copy of that object. Updates to the object will automatically propagate to the copies.\n\nThe distributed network is composed of several layers: the dc file which defines the communication, ServerRepositories which handle communication between clients, ClientRepositories which interact and manage the distributed objects, and the distributed objects themselves.\n\nSeveral abbreviations will be used in the following pages that you may come across when using the system. To not repeat them every time or for you to look up whenever you stumble upon one, we'll list them here.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nservers server-repositories ai-repositories clients client-repositories dc-definition-files client-created-objects ai-created-objects uber-dogs owner-view time-manager related-object-manager distributed-object distributed-node distributed-smooth-node",
