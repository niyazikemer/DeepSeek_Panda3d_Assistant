  "content": "Using Intervals to move the Panda\n\nIntervals and Sequences\n\nintervals\n\nIntervals are tasks that change a property from one value to another over a specified period of time. Starting an interval effectively starts a background process that modifies the property over the specified period of time.\n\nSequences <sequences-and-parallels>\n\nSequences, sometimes called MetaIntervals, are a type of interval that contains other intervals. Playing a sequence will cause each contained interval to execute in sequence, one after the other.\n\nThe Program\n\nUpdate the Code\n\nThe next step is to cause the panda to actually move back and forth. Update the code to the following:\n\npython\n\nusing-intervals-to-move-the-panda.py\n\ncpp\n\nusing-intervals-to-move-the-panda.cxx\n\nWhen the pandaPosInterval1 interval is started, it will gradually adjust the position of the panda from (0, 10, 0) to (0, -10, 0) over a period of 13 seconds. Similarly, when the pandaHprInterval1 interval is started, the heading of the panda will rotate 180 degrees over a period of 3 seconds.\n\nThe pandaPace sequence above causes the panda to move in a straight line, turn, move in the opposite straight line, and finally turn again. The code pandaPace.loop() causes the Sequence to be started in looping mode.\n\nRun the Program\n\nThe result of all this is to cause the panda to pace back and forth from one tree to the other.",
