This is not a frequently-used capability, but it does have a few applications:\n\nWhen using red-blue 3D glasses, you might want to render the red image, then the blue image. (In fact, Panda uses this technique automatically when you set red-blue-stereo 1 in your Config.prc file.)\n\nBattletech Battle Pods connect 3 black-and-white monitors to a single R,G,B video card output (really!) With the help of color write masks, you could update an individual monitor.\n\nSometimes, one wants to store data in the alpha-channel of the framebuffer. Using a color mask can avoid accidentally overwriting that data.\n\nUsing a color write-mask is not free. During normal rendering, each pixel written to the frame buffer requires a memory write. With a color-mask active, a memory read-modify-write cycle is needed, which is more expensive.\n\nBy default, color write masks are off.\n\nTurning on the Color Mask\n\nTo enable writes to all the channels of the framebuffer, use this:\n\npython\n\nnodePath.setAttrib(ColorWriteAttrib.make(ColorWriteAttrib.CAll))\n\ncpp\n\nnodePath.set_attrib(ColorWriteAttrib::make(ColorWriteAttrib::C_all));\n\nThis can also be done by combining separate attributes for individual channels, like the following:\n\npython\n\nbits = ColorWriteAttrib.CAlpha\nbits |= ColorWriteAttrib.CRed\nbits |= ColorWriteAttrib.CGreen\nbits |= ColorWriteAttrib.CBlue\nnodePath.setAttrib(ColorWriteAttrib.make(bits))\n\ncpp\n\nint bits = ColorWriteAttrib::C_alpha;\nbits |= ColorWriteAttrib::C_red;\nbits |= ColorWriteAttrib::C_green;\nbits |= ColorWriteAttrib::C_blue;\nnodePath.set_attrib(ColorWriteAttrib::make(bits));\n\nTo disable writes to one or more channels, omit that bit in the code above.",
