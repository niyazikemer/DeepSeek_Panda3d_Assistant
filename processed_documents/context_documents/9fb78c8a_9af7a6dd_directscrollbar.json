  "content": "DirectScrollBar\n\npython\n\nA DirectScrollBar is similar to the \"scroll bar\" widget commonly used by the user to page through a large document. It consists of a long trough, a thumb that slides along the trough, and a pair of buttons on either side of the trough to scroll one line at a time. A DirectScrollBar can be oriented either vertically or horizontally.\n\nThe DirectScrollBar is similar in function to directslider, but it is specifically designed for scrolling through a large window. In fact, a pair of DirectScrollBars is used to implement the directscrolledframe, which manages this scrolling functionality automatically. (Because DirectScrolledFrame exists, you will probably not need to create a DirectScrollBar directly, unless you have some custom purpose that requires a scroll bar.)\n\nDirectScrollBar has many things in common with directslider. Like directslider, the normal DirectGui parameters such as frameSize, geom, and relief control the look of the trough. You can control the look of the thumb by prefixing each of these parameters with the prefix \"thumb_\", e.g. thumb_frameSize; similarly, you can control the look of the two scroll buttons by prefixing these with \"incButton_\" and \"decButton_\". You can retrieve or set the current position of the thumb with myScrollBar['value'].\n\nKeyword Definition Value value Initial position of the thumb Default is 0 range The (min, max) range of the thumb Default is (0, 1) pageSize The amount to jump the thumb when the user clicks left or right, (up\nor down if the scrollbar is vertical), of the thumb; this also controls\nthe width of the thumb when resizeThumb is True Default is 0.1 scrollSize The amount to move the thumb when the user clicks once on either\nscroll button Default is 0.01 orientation The orientation of the scroll bar DGG.HORIZONTAL or DGG.VERTICAL manageButtons Whether to automatically adjust the buttons when the scroll bar\u2019s\nframe is changed True or False resizeThumb Whether to adjust the width of the thumb to reflect the ratio of\npageSize to the overall range; requires manageButtons to be True as\nwell True or False command Function called when the position of the thumb changes (takes no\narguments) Function extraArgs Extra arguments to the function specified in command [Extra Arguments] thumb_geom, thumb_relief, thumb_text, thumb_frameSize, etc. Parameters to control the look of the thumb Any parameters appropriate to directbutton incButton_geom, incButton_relief, incButton_text,\nincButton_frameSize, etc. Parameters to control the look of the lower or right scroll\nbutton Any parameters appropriate to directbutton decButton_geom, decButton_relief, decButton_text,\ndecButton_frameSize, etc. Parameters to control the look of the upper or left scroll\nbutton Any parameters appropriate to directbutton\n\nHere is a small example on how to create the scrollbar:\n\nfrom direct.gui.DirectGui import DirectScrollBar\n\nmybar = DirectScrollBar(range=(0, 100), value=50, pageSize=3, orientation= DGG.VERTICAL)\nmybar.setPos(-1, 0, -0.5)\n\nThis will give you a scrollbar at the lower left side of the screen. If you want to parent the scrollbar to a determined frame, you add the keyword parent to the set of keyboards like so:\n\nmybar = DirectScrollBar(parent=myframe, range=(0,100), value=50, pageSize=3, orientation= DGG.VERTICAL)\nmybar.setPos(-1, 0, -0.5)",
