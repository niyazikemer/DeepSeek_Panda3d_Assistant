  "content": "AI-side Created Objects\n\nSimilar to the client-side created objects, AI server-side created objects will be created and managed on the AI server. The difference is that the classes with the AI suffix will be used to create the DistributedObject. The respective class without the AI suffix will be created on clients that stated with the AI appending will usually be used for creation and hence the AI functionality of those nodes can be accessed. Those objects will also be distributed to the clients.\n\nAn example for creating an AI object directly on the AI server follows.\n\nself.gameDistObjectAI = self.createDistributedObject(\n    className = 'DGameObjectAI',\n    zoneId = 2)\n\nFor a client to know when such an object has been manifested locally, the distributed object class (without the AI postfix) can overwrite the ~direct.distributed.DistributedObject.DistributedObject.announceGenerate() method of .DistributedObject. This method is called whenever the object has been created and is ready for further processing on the client. In this method, you can for example send the doId with a custom event or simply store some information in the client repository to later ease the access to those objects.",
