  "content": "Sample Programs: Solar System\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nThis sample program shows planets orbiting around the sun, and a moon orbiting one of the planets. If you just stare at the moon, you'll realize that its motion is a spiral:\n\nThe motion of the moon is only simple if you think about it in relative terms: the moon is moving in a circle relative to the planet, and the planet is moving in a circle relative to the sun.\n\nThis panda program shows how to implement relative movement and relative positioning.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
