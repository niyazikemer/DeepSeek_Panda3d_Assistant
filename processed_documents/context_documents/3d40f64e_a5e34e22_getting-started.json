  "content": "Getting Started\n\nThe basics : Theory :\n\nThe PandAI library has been built upon the design pattern of composition.\n\nThere exists a main AIWorld Class which governs all updates of any AICharacters added to it. Each AICharacter has its own AIBehavior object which keeps track of all position and rotation updates based on the type of AI which is acting on that character.\n\nSo in short : AIWorld -> AICharacter -> AIBehavior\n\nEach AIBehavior object has the functionality to implement all the steering behaviors and pathfinding behaviors. So once you get a reference to this object from the AICharacter, it should give you the ability to call the respective functions.\n\nImplementation:\n\nFollowing are the steps to get the basics of PandAI working. Don't worry if you can't understand some of them.\n\nStep 1:\n\nTo use our AI library into your game you need to import PandAI into your game code via:\n\nfrom panda3d.ai import *\n\nStep 2:\n\nCreate an object of the AIWorld class which defines your AI in your game world.\n\nStep 3:\n\nSetup a task which runs continuously which keeps calling the 'Update()' function for your previously created AIWorld object\n\nStep 4:\n\nTo test this out let us also implement a simple call to the 'seek' behavior function in PandAI. To do this we need two objects: A seeker and a target. For this example, we will use Ralph (seeker) and an arrow model (target).\n\nStep 5:\n\nCreate an 'AICharacter' object and attach it to your AIWorld class (previously created). The AICharacter constructor looks for a NodePath, this can be a Model or an Actor or even an Empty NodePath.\n\nStep 6:\n\nGet a reference to the AIBehaviors object of your previously created AICharacter class via the 'getAiBehaviors' function().\n\nStep 7:\n\nCall the seek function on your AIBehaviors reference (previously created). The seek function takes a NodePath or a Vector3 position to seek to.\n\nStep 8:\n\nStart your AIWorld update task which you created earlier.\n\nStep 9:\n\nWatch how your awesome seek function works!\n\nThe actual code:\n\nimport direct.directbase.DirectStart\nfrom panda3d.core import *\nfrom direct.showbase.DirectObject import DirectObject\nfrom direct.task import Task\nfrom direct.actor.Actor import Actor\n#for Pandai\nfrom panda3d.ai import *\n\nclass World(DirectObject):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        base.disableMouse()\n        base.cam.setPosHpr(0, 0, 55, 0, -90, 0)\n\n        self.loadModels()\n        self.setAI()\n\n    def loadModels(self):\n        # Seeker\n        ralphStartPos = Vec3(-10, 0, 0)\n        self.seeker = Actor(\"models/ralph\",\n                            {\"run\":\"models/ralph-run\"})\n        self.seeker.reparentTo(render)\n        self.seeker.setScale(0.5)\n        self.seeker.setPos(ralphStartPos)\n        # Target\n        self.target = loader.loadModel(\"models/arrow\")\n        self.target.setColor(1, 0, 0)\n        self.target.setPos(5, 0, 0)\n        self.target.setScale(1)\n        self.target.reparentTo(render)\n\n    def setAI(self):\n        #Creating AI World\n        self.AIworld = AIWorld(render)\n\n        self.AIchar = AICharacter(\"seeker\",self.seeker, 100, 0.05, 5)\n        self.AIworld.addAiChar(self.AIchar)\n        self.AIbehaviors = self.AIchar.getAiBehaviors()\n\n        self.AIbehaviors.seek(self.target)\n        self.seeker.loop(\"run\")\n\n        #AI World update\n        taskMgr.add(self.AIUpdate,\"AIUpdate\")\n\n    #to update the AIWorld\n    def AIUpdate(self,task):\n        self.AIworld.update()\n        return Task.cont\n\nw = World()\nbase.run()\n\nNote It doesn't matter where your seek is first called (ie. before the AIWorld update or after) it should still work as soon as the Update starts processing.\n\nNote: This above example is only for seek but if you go to each of the pages, a separate example is provided showing you each AI individually.\n\nIf you want to get a working demo of this tutorial, please visit :\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/etcpandai/documentation/getting-started/PandAIBasicTutorial.zip?attredirects=0&d=1\n\nNext Step:\n\nNow that you have a basic working program of PandAI, you should proceed to the Steering Behaviors page and gain more knowledge of the system from there.",
