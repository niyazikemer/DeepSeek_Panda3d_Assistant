  "content": "DSP Effects\n\nDSP, or Digital Signal Processing, allows you to apply effect filters to your in-game audio. As of now, DSP effects are only available in Panda if you use the FMOD audio library. By default, Panda ships using the OpenAL audio library but FMOD can be enabled simply by editing Config.prc <configuring-panda3d>. Please keep in mind that using FMOD in a commercial application will require purchasing a license.\n\nYou will need to change this line in your Config.prc: (some versions of Panda3D might already be set to FMOD)\n\naudio-library-name p3openal_audio\n\nTo this:\n\naudio-library-name p3fmod_audio\n\nThe FilterProperties Object\n\nAny DSP you add to your sound will require the use of .FilterProperties, which is a list of filters and their coefficients. Start with this import:\n\nfrom panda3d.core import FilterProperties\n\nThis will allow you to create lists of filters, like this one:\n\nfp = FilterProperties()\n\nThis just adds a blank filter list. From here we can add whatever filter we'd like. To stay consistent with the example below, we'll add a reverb effect.\n\nfp.addReverb(0.6, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1)\n\nAll this really does is add this particular reverb to our filter list - sound is not yet affected. To apply these filters to our audio output, use:\n\naudioMgr.configureFilters(fp)\n\nwhere audioMgr is an .AudioManager object, most likely base.sfxManagerList <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.sfxManagerList> or base.musicManager <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.musicManager>.\n\nDepending on the sound you use, reverb may be very or only slightly noticeable; try using a quick sound at first, like a clap.\n\nYou can add more than just reverb to your sound. The full list of available filters is here:\n\npanda3d.core.FilterProperties\n\nBelow is a sample program for adding a reverb effect:\n\n# This is just to ensure that we are using FMOD. In your application,\n# please edit the Config.prc file that you distribute\nfrom panda3d.core import loadPrcFileData\nloadPrcFileData(\"\", \"audio-library-name p3fmod_audio\")\n\nfrom direct.showbase.ShowBase import ShowBase\nfrom panda3d.core import FilterProperties\n\nbase = ShowBase()\n\nmySound = loader.loadSfx(\"models/audio/sfx/GUI_rollover.wav\")\nmySound.setLoop(True)\nmySound.play()\n\nfp = FilterProperties()\nfp.addReverb(0.6, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1)\nbase.sfxManagerList[0].configureFilters(fp)\n\nbase.run()",
