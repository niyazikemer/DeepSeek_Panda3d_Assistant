  "content": "Sound Intervals\n\nSee loading-and-playing-sounds-and-music for basic information on how to load and play sounds.\n\nSound intervals play sounds from inside an interval. Like actor intervals, sound intervals have a loop parameter and the ability to be paused. Sound intervals also have volume and start time parameters.\n\nmySound = loader.loadSfx(\"mySound.wav\")\n\nmyInterval = SoundInterval(\n    mySound,\n    loop = 0 or 1,\n    duration = myDuration,\n    volume = myVolume,\n    startTime = myStartTime\n)\n\nThe looping provided by the sound interval is not clean. There will be a pause between loops of roughly a tenth of a second. See manipulating-sounds for a better way to loop sounds.",
