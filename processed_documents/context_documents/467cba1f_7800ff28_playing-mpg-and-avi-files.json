  "content": "Playing MPG and AVI files\n\nPanda now supports AVI format for textures in Panda.\n\nUsage\n\nmyMovieTexture = loader.loadTexture(\"myMovie.avi\")\nmyObject.setTexture(myMovieTexture)\n\nThe movie subsystem is implemented using FFMPEG. Therefore, it supports all of the formats that FFMPEG supports. The functions to control the movie are as follows:\n\nmovie.play()\nmovie.stop()\nmovie.setTime(t)\nmovie.getTime()\nmovie.setLoopCount(n)\nmovie.getLoopCount()\nmovie.setPlayRate(speed)\nmovie.getPlayRate()\nmovie.isPlaying()\n\nIf you want to hear the movie's audio as well, you need to load it twice: once as a texture, and once as a sound file:\n\nmySound = loader.loadSfx(\"myMovie.avi\")\n\nThen, you can synchronize the video to the audio:\n\nmyMovieTexture.synchronizeTo(mySound)\n\nFrom that point forward, playing the audio will cause the texture to update. This is more accurate than synchronizing the video manually.\n\nFor powers-of-two limited graphics hardware\n\nIf your graphics hardware does not support non power-of-two textures, your movie texture size would be shifted up to the next larger power of two size. For example, if you have a movie of 640 x 360 in size, the generated texture would be actually 1024 x 512. The result is a texture that contains a movie in the lower-left corner, and a black pad region to the right and upper portion of the texture.\n\nTo work around this limit, you have to display just the lower-left portion of the texture. To see a complete demonstration of this process, see the Media Player sample program.\n\nIssues\n\nThe video texture works by decoding on a frame by frame basis and copying into the texture buffer. As such, it is inadvisable to use more than a few high res video textures at the same time.\n\nCertain encoding formats do not work. So far, DV format has been determined incompatible with Panda.",
