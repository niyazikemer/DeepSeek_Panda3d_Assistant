  "content": "Sample Programs: Fractal Plants\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nThis sample program isn't so much about fractals as it is about synthesizing a 3D model. Ie, this program does not include any 3D models on disk - it generates the trees procedurally.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
