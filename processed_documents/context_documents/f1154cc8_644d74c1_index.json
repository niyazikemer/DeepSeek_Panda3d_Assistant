  "content": "Pathfinding\n\nPathfinding\n\nThis deals with the NPC\u2019s ability to calculate the best route between two traversable points in your Panda3D environment. It requires the creation of a navigation mesh (see \u201cNavigation Mesh\u201d under \"Mesh Generator\" page), which is placed on the surface over which your NPC will be moving. The navigation mesh allows the system to recognize \u201ctraversable nodes\u201d around the mesh, as well as areas which cannot be traversed (areas occupied by an impediment or obstacle for instance).\n\nUsing the PandAI pathfinding system:\n\naiBehaviors.initPathFind(string filename)\n\nThis function activates the path finding with A* for the AI Character. Filename is the name of the file that is generated by the Mesh Generator (Covered in the next section of the manual).\n\n(Note: The file is in .csv format)\n\naiBehaviors.pathFindTo(NodePath np, string type)\n\naiBehaviors.pathFindTo(Vec3 pos, string type)\n\nThis function finds the best path via A* algorithm (with Binary Heap optimizations) for the AI Character to reach the target destination and then invokes the path follower to make the object follow the path.\n\nIt can accept both NodePath and Vec3 as input position. NodePath is used when the destination is not static. Vec3 is used when the destination is going to be static.\n\nIf the AI Character needs to pathfind continuously(say after he has finished traversing to a position, a new destination is acquired ) then input string type as \u201caddPath\u201d else leave as default.\n\naddStaticObstacle(NodePath obstacle);\n\nThis function is used if the programmer wants to add Obstacles after the mesh has been generated (Say a stack of boxes fall down and blocks the way) to trigger events. It adds a static obstacle to the navigation mesh and pathfinds around it.\n\naddDynamicObstacle(NodePath obstacle);\n\nThis functions work similar to addStaticObstacle except that in this case the obstacles can move and are not static. This is more processor heavy so if your object is not moving, use the prior instead.\n\nmesh-generation static-obstacles dynamic-obstacles uneven-terrain",
