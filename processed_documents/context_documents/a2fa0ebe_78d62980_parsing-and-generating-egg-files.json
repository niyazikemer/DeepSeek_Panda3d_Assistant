  "content": "Parsing and Generating Egg Files\n\nTransforms and Vertices\n\nThe egg syntax defines all transforms, including joint transforms, relative to the parent node only. When the animation is played, Panda accumulates the transforms for each joint.\n\nAlthough joints are defined using a local transform, vertices are defined in an egg file using global coordinates, which is irrespective of transforms appearing within the egg file. This means when Panda loads the egg file is loaded, the vertex coordinates given in the egg file must be pre-transformed by the appropriate inverse matrix to compensate.\n\nCustom .egg Readers/Writers\n\nWhen writing an importer or exporter for panda, you have two choices.\n\nOne option is to use the panda runtime library, which includes code for reading, parsing, storing, and emitting Egg files. This approach can save you a great deal of effort. However, it does require that you link with the panda runtime system, which may be inconvenient if you wish to distribute a small, standalone file translator.\n\nIf you decide to use the panda runtime system, the classes you will need to use are defined in the panda3d.egg module, such as .EggData, .EggGroup, and so forth. Like all Panda3D classes, these are documented in the API reference <reference>.\n\nThe other alternative is to parse/generate the Egg file entirely by yourself. In this case, you will need to read the egg-syntax documentation. The file format is human-readable, and fairly straightforward.\n\nIf you are writing a program to generate Egg files, either approach is equally good. However, if you are writing a program to parse Egg files, we do recommend using the panda runtime library, rather than writing your own parser, for the simple reason that it is difficult to write a parser that accepts all valid Egg files. Also, the Egg syntax might be extended from time to time, and relying on the runtime library to parse the Egg syntax will ensure that your program continues to parse future Egg files.",
