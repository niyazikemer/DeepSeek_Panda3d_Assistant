  "content": "GeomVertexFormat\n\nThe .GeomVertexFormat object describes how the columns of a GeomVertexData are ordered and named, and exactly what kind of numeric data is stored in each column. Every GeomVertexData has an associated GeomVertexFormat, which describes how the data in that object is stored.\n\nJust as a GeomVertexData object is really a list of one or more GeomVertexArrayData objects, a GeomVertexFormat object is a list of one or more GeomVertexArrayFormat objects, each of which defines the structure of the corresponding array. There will be one GeomVertexArrayFormat object for each array in the format. Each GeomVertexArrayFormat, in turn, consists of a list of GeomVertexColumn objects, one for each column in the array. For instance, the format for a GeomVertexData with six columns, distributed over three different arrays, might look like this:\n\nGeomVertexFormat GeomVertexArrayFormat GeomVertexColumn GeomVertexColumn GeomVertexColumn GeomVertexArrayFormat GeomVertexColumn GeomVertexArrayFormat GeomVertexColumn GeomVertexColumn\n\nEach GeomVertexColumn has a number of properties:\n\nA column may have any name (though each name must be unique within a given GeomVertexFormat). If there are additional columns with names other than those in the above table, Panda will not do anything special with the columns, but it will send the vertex data to any vertex shader that requests that data by name, using the vtx_columnname parameter name. See List of Possible Shader Inputs <list-of-possible-cg-shader-inputs>.\n\nThere are also additional properties associated with each GeomVertexColumn that determine its exact offset and byte-alignment within each row of the array, but normally you do not need to worry about these, unless you are designing a GeomVertexFormat that matches some already-existing block of data. See the auto-generated API specification for more details.",
