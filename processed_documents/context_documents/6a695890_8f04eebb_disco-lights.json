  "content": "Sample Programs: Disco Lights\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nThis sample program demonstrates lighting in panda. Lighting in panda can add a lot of depth into a scene. In panda, you can create point, directional, ambient and spot lights (for a detailed description of these lights, see the manual link below). Lights in Panda can also optionally cast shadows. For more information on lighting, please consult the Panda3D online manual.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
