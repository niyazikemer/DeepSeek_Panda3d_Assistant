  "content": "Particle Renderers\n\nParticle renderers add particles to the visible scene graph according to the information stored in the particle objects and the type of renderer. All particle renderers have the following parameters:\n\nVariable Definition Values alphaMode Alpha setting over particle lifetime PR_ALPHA_NONE, PR_ALPHA_OUT, PR_ALPHA_IN, PR_ALPHA_USER userAlpha Alpha value for ALPHA_USER alpha mode Boolean\n\nThe following list contains the different types of renderers and their unique parameters.\n\nPointParticleRenderer\n\nRenders particles as pixel points.\n\nVariable Definition Values pointSize Width and height of points, in pixels [0, infinity) startColor Starting color (r, g, b, a) endColor Ending color (r, g, b, a) blendType How the particles blend from the start color to the end color ONE_COLOR, BLEND_LIFE, BLEND_VEL blendMethod Interpolation method between colors LINEAR, CUBIC\n\nONE_COLOR: point is always the starting color.\n\nBLEND_LIFE: color is interpolated from start to end according to the age of the point\n\nBLEND_VEL: color is interpolated between start to end according to the velocity/terminal velocity.\n\nLineParticleRenderer\n\nRenders particles as lines between their current position and their last position.\n\nVariable Definition Values headColor Color of leading end (r, g, b, a) tailColor Color of trailing end (r, g, b, a)\n\nSparkleParticleRenderer\n\nRenders particles star or sparkle objects, three equal-length perpendicular axial lines, much like jacks. Sparkle particles appear to sparkle when viewed as being smaller than a pixel.\n\nVariable Definition Values centerColor Color of center (r, g, b, a) edgeColor Color of edge (r, g, b, a) birthRadius Initial sparkle radius [0, infinity) deathRadius Final sparkle radius [0, infinity) lifeScale Whether or not sparkle is always of radius birthRadius NO_SCALE, SCALE\n\nSpriteParticleRenderer\n\nRenders particles as an image, using a Panda3D texture object. The image is always facing the user.\n\nVariable Definition Values texture Panda texture object to use as the sprite image (r, g, b, a) color Color (r, g, b, a) xScaleFlag If true, x scale is interpolated over particle\u2019s life Boolean yScaleFlag If true, y scale is interpolated over particle\u2019s life Boolean animAngleFlag If true, particles are set to spin on the Z axis Boolean initial_X_Scale Initial x scaling factor [0, infinity) final_X_Scale Final x scaling factor [0, infinity) initial_Y_Scale Initial y scaling factor [0, infinity) final_Y_Scale Final y scaling factor [0, infinity) nonAnimatedTheta If false, sets the counterclockwise Z rotation of all sprites, in\ndegrees Boolean alphaBlendMethod Sets the interpolation blend method LINEAR, CUBIC alphaDisable If true, alpha blending is disabled Boolean\n\nGeomParticleRenderer\n\nRenders particles as full 3D objects. This requires a geometry node.\n\nVariable Definition Values geomNode A geometry scene graph node",
