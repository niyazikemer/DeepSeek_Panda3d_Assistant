  "content": "Camera Control\n\nPanda3D's camera is considered a .PandaNode. It can therefore be manipulated as any other node.\n\nThe actual camera is defined in ShowBase as a .NodePath named base.cam <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.cam>. There is also a plain node above the camera, which is a NodePath called base.camera <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.camera>. Generally you want to control the latter with your code.\n\ndefault-camera-driver perspective-lenses orthographic-lenses",
