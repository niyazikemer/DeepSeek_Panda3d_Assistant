  "content": "Using Bullet with Panda3D\n\nBullet is a modern and open source physics engine used in many games or simulations. Bullet can be compiled on many platforms, among them Windows, Linux and macOS. Bullet features include collision detection, rigid body dynamics, soft body dynamics and a kinematic character controller.\n\nThis section is about how to use the Panda3D Bullet module.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nhello-world debug-renderer collision-shapes collision-filtering ccd queries ghosts character-controller constraints vehicles softbodies softbody-rope softbody-patch softbody-triangles softbody-tetrahedron softbody-config config-options faq samples\n\nAll Bullet classes are prefixed with \"Bullet\". A list of all classes and their methods can be found from the panda3d.bullet page of the API Reference. However, the class and function descriptions are still missing.\n\nNote\n\nThe Panda3D Bullet module makes great effort to integrate Bullet physics as tightly as reasonably possible with the core Panda3D classes. However, when implementing collision detection and physics, you can not mix Panda3D's internal physics & collision system, ODE, and Bullet. More explicitly: Bullet bodies won't collide with ODE bodies and CollisionNodes.\n\nSamples on how to use the Panda3D Bullet module can be found in the following archive: https://www.panda3d.org/download/noversion/bullet-samples.zip\n\ncpp\n\nNote: All samples are currently available in Python code only.",
