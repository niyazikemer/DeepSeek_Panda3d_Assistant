This object, when created is also propagated to the clients if they define interest in the specific zone the manager has been created in.\n\nClients may also simply access the time manager from the timeManager variable defined in the CR when it has been created on the AI and the client has stated interest in the zone the time manager lives in.\n\nTo make the time manager available from the AI server, create a .TimeManagerAI instance. Simply do the same as you\u2019d do to create a DirectObject.\n\nself.timeManager = self.createDistributedObject(\n    className = 'TimeManagerAI',\n    zoneId = 1)",
