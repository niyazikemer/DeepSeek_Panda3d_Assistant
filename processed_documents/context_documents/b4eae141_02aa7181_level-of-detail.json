  "content": "Level of Detail\n\nTo make a scene look as good as possible, modellers often like to make them very intricately detailed, which requires a model to consist of a high amount of polygons. However, if every model in a scene were so highly detailed, Panda3D would spend a lot of time animating and rendering the scene every frame, causing the performance to drop.\n\nA common technique to prevent this is to create multiple levels of detail for a model. A highly detailed version of the model is used when it is close to the camera, whereas if the model is far away, a lower resolution version is used, since the detail is not discernable at a great distance anyway.\n\nAnother use would be to combine several small objects into a simplified single object, or to apply a shader that is less costly to render at a greater distance. LOD can also be used to hide objects when they are far away.\n\ncpp\n\nInclude file:\n\n#include \"lodNode.h\"\n\nTo create an .LODNode and .NodePath:\n\npython\n\nlod = LODNode('my LOD node')\nlod_np = NodePath(lod)\nlod_np.reparentTo(render)\n\ncpp\n\nPT(LODNode) lod = new LODNode(\"my LOD node\");\nNodePath lod_np (lod);\nlod_np.reparent_to(render);\n\nTo add a level of detail to the LODNode:\n\npython\n\nlod.addSwitch(50.0, 0.0)\nmy_model.reparentTo(lod_np)\n\ncpp\n\nlod->add_switch(50.0, 0.0);\nmy_model.reparent_to(lod_np);\n\nmy_model can be any NodePath you like.\n\nNote that the first argument is the \"far\" distance after which this LOD will disappear, and the second argument is the \"near\" distance at which it will appear.\n\nContinue this pattern to add as many levels of detail as you like. For your lowest level of detail the far distance will be where the model will disappear. If you would prefer it to stay visible even when very far away then use a sufficiently large number for the far distance.\n\nNote that the order in which the switches are added must be the same as the order in which the LODs are reparented to the LODNode's NodePath. This is important to remember if you are not reparenting the LOD immediately after adding the switch.",
