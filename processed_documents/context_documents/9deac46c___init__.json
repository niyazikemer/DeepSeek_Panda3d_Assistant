  "content": "\"\"\"\nThis package contains functionality for applying post-processing\nfilters to the result of rendering a 3-D scene.  This is done by\nrendering the scene to an off-screen buffer, and then applying this to\na full-screen card that has a shader applied which manipulates the\ntexture values as desired.\n\nThe :class:`.CommonFilters` class contains various filters that are\nprovided out of the box, whereas the :class:`.FilterManager` class\nis a lower-level class that allows you to set up your own filters.\n\nSee the :ref:`render-to-texture-and-image-postprocessing` section of the\nProgramming Guide to learn more about image postprocessing in Panda3D.\n\"\"\"\n",
