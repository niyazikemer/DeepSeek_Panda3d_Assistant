  "content": "Texturing\n\nAt its simplest, texturing merely consists of applying a texture in your modeling program. When you export the model, the path to the texture and some options for it like filtering or repeat-method (see next pages) are saved into the egg file. The texture paths can be either relative (as seen from the egg file) or absolute (full path). See filename-syntax for more info about Panda's filename syntax. In most cases the relative path makes more sense.\n\nPanda can load JPG, PNG, TIF, and a number of other file formats.\n\nMore advanced texturing methods are described in the following sections.\n\nsimple-texturing choosing-a-texture-size texture-wrap-modes texture-filter-types simple-texture-replacement multitexture-introduction texture-modes texture-order texture-combine-modes texture-transforms multiple-texture-coordinate-sets automatic-texture-coordinates projected-textures simple-environment-mapping 3d-textures cube-maps environment-mapping-with-cube-maps automatic-texture-animation playing-mpg-and-avi-files multiview-textures transparency-and-blending texture-management texture-compression creating-textures",
