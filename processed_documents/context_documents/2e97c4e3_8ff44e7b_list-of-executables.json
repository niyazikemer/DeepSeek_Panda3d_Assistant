  "content": "List of Panda3D Executables\n\nThis is meant to be a list of the executables in the /bin/ folder of Panda3D. You can get a detailed synopsis of what the executables do by running them with -h as the argument.\n\nFilename Description bam-info.exe Scans one or more .bam files and outputs their contents. See\nexecutable for more information. bam2egg.exe Converts models in the .bam format to the .egg format. For more\ninformation see converting-egg-to-bam . cgc.exe A compiler for NVidia\u2019s Cg language. For more information see Using Cg Shaders <shader-basics> . dxf-points.exe Reads in an AutoCad .dxf file and prints out the points contained in\nit. See executable for more information. dxf2egg.exe Converts models from the AutoCad format to the .egg format. For more\ninformation see converting-to-egg egg-crop.exe Strips an .egg file of all parts that fall outside the given\nbounding volume. See executable for more information. egg-make-tube.exe Creates an .egg file representing a \u201ctube\u201d model. See executable for\nmore information. egg-mkfont.exe Makes a .egg file from a FreeType (.ttf) font. For more information\nsee text-fonts . egg-optchar.exe Optimizes models by removing unused joints. Also allow you to label\nparts of the model. For more information see manipulating-a-piece-of-a-model . egg-palettize.exe Tries to combine textures in an egg file. Also performs some texture\nmanipulation. See executable for more information. egg-qtess.exe Performs a tesselation on all of the NURBS surfaces in a .egg file.\nSee executable for more information. egg-texture-cards.exe Creates an egg that automatically rotates through multiple textures.\nFor more information see automatic-texture-animation . egg-topstrip.exe Unapplies the animations from one of the top joints in a model.\nUseful for character models that stack on top of each other. See\nexecutable for more information egg-trans.exe Produces out essentially the same .egg file. Useful for applying\nrotational and positional transformations. See executable for more\ninformation. egg2bam.exe Converts files in the .egg format to the .bam format. For more\ninformation see converting-egg-to-bam . egg2c.exe Reads a .egg file and produce C/C++ code that will almost compile.\nSee executable for more information. egg2dxf.exe Converts files in the .egg format to the AutoCad format. egg2flt.exe Converts files in the .egg format to the Open Flight format. egg2x.exe Converts files in the .egg format to the DirectX format. Especially\nuseful because it holds bone, joint and animation data. flt-info.exe Reads an OpenFlight file and prints out information about its\ncontents. See executable for more information. flt-trans.exe Produces essentially the same .flt file. Useful for positional and\nrotational transformations. See executable for more information. flt2egg.exe Converts files in the OpenFlight format to the .egg format. For more\ninformation see converting-to-egg . image-info.exe Reports the sizes of one or more images. See executable for more\ninformation. image-resize.exe Resizes an image. See executable for more information. image-trans.exe Produces an identical picture. Can also be used for file format\nconversion. See executable for more information. interrogate.exe Parses C++ code and creates wrappers so that it can be called in a\nScripting language. For more information see interrogate lwo-scan.exe Prints the contents of a .lwo file. See executable for more\ninformation. lwo2egg.exe Converts files in the LightWave 3D format to the .egg format. For\nmore information see converting-to-egg . make-prc-key.exe Generates one or more new key to be used for signing a prc file. See\nexecutable for more information. maya2egg5.exe Converts files in the Maya 5 format to the .egg format. For more\ninformation see converting-from-maya . maya2egg6.exe Converts files in the Maya 6 format to the .egg format. For more\ninformation see converting-from-maya . maya2egg65.exe Converts files in the Maya 6.5 format to the .egg format. For more\ninformation see converting-from-maya . multify.exe Stores and extracts files from a Panda MultiFile. Can also extract\nfile in program using the VirtualFileSystem (see API for usage). For\nmore information see executable. pdecrypt.exe Decompress a file compressed by pencrypt. See executable for more\ninformation. pencrypt.exe Runs an encryption algorithm on the specified file. The original\nfile can only be recovered by using pdecrypt. See executable for more\ninformation. python.exe The Python interpreter. For more information see starting-panda3d pstats.exe Panda\u2019s built in performance tool. For more information see measuring-performance-with-pstats pview.exe Used to view models in the .egg or .bam format without having to\ncreate a Panda program. For more information see pview . vrml2egg.exe Converts files in the Virtual Reality Modeling Language format to\nthe .egg format. For more information see converting-to-egg . x2egg.exe Converts files in the Direct X format to the .egg format. Especially\nuseful because it holds bone, joint and animation data.
