  "content": "List of All Config Variables\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of config variables as of June 2020, using Panda3D 1.10.4.1. Some, but not all, variables were generated using this code:\n\npython\n\nConfigVariableManager.getGlobalPtr().listVariables()\nConfigVariableManager.getGlobalPtr.listDynamicVariables()\n\ncpp\n\nConfigVariableManager::get_global_ptr()->list_variables();\nConfigVariableManager::get_global_ptr()->list_dynamic_variables();\n\nBear in mind that this list includes configuration parameters that control functionality that isn't fully implemented yet. Ie, not all of these config variables are as useful as they sound.\n\nYou can use this command yourself, refer to the ~panda3d.core.ConfigVariableManager class , or check for ConfigVariable calls within the source code in case this list gets out of date.\n\nList of Panda3D variables:\n\nVariable Type Default Description accept-clock-skew bool 0 This controls the default value of\nSmoothMover::get_accept_clock_skew(). accum-bits int 0 The minimum number of accumulator buffer bits requested. adaptive-lru-max-updates-per-frame int 40 The number of pages the AdaptiveLru class will update per frame. Do\nnot set this too high or it will degrade performance. adaptive-lru-weight double 0.2 Specifies the weight factor used to compute the AdaptiveLru's\nexponential moving average. ae-undershift-factor-16 double 1.004 Specifies the factor by which After Effects under-applies the\nspecified maximum pixel shift when applying a displacement map, in a\n16-bit project file. This is used to control\nPfmVizzer::make_displacement(). ae-undershift-factor-32 double 1.0 Specifies the factor by which After Effects under-applies the\nspecified maximum pixel shift when applying a displacement map, in a\n32-bit project file. This is used to control\nPfmVizzer::make_displacement(). allow-async-bind bool 1 allow-collider-multiple bool 0 Set this true to enable the use of a DoubleBitMask or QuadBitMask to\nmanage many colliders added to a single traverser in one pass. If this\nis false, a one-word BitMask is always used instead, which is faster per\npass, but may require more passes. allow-flatten-color bool 0 allows color to always be flattened to vertices allow-incomplete-render bool 1 When this is true, the frame may be rendered even if some of the\ngeometry in the scene has been paged out, or if the textures are\nunavailable. The nonresident geometry and textures will be rendered as\nsoon as they can be read from disk, which may be several frames in the\nfuture. When this is false, geometry is always paged in immediately when\nneeded, holding up the frame render if necessary. allow-live-flatten bool 1 Set this true to allow the use of flatten_strong() or any variant on\na node that is attached to a live scene graph node, or false to disallow\nthis. Flattening a live scene graph node can cause problems when\nthreading is enabled. This variable only has an effect when Panda is not\ncompiled for a release build. allow-nonpipeline-threads bool 0 This variable should only be set true for debugging or development\npurposes. When true, the threading-model variable may specify a threaded\npipeline mode, even if pipelining is not compiled in. This will\ncertainly result in erroneous behavior, and quite likely will cause a\ncrash. Do not set this unless you know what you are doing. allow-portal-cull bool 0 Set this true to enable portal clipping. This will enable the\nrenderer to cull more objects that are clipped if not in the current\nlist of portals. This is still somewhat experimental. allow-unrelated-wrt bool 1 Set this true to allow unrelated NodePaths (that is, nodes which\nhave no common ancestor) to be adjusted relative to each other. If true,\nthese will be treated as if they had a common node above their top\nnodes. alpha-bits int 0 (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded The minimum number of alpha buffer bits requested. alpha-scale-via-texture bool 1 When this is true, Panda will try to implement ColorScaleAttribs\nthat affect alpha by creating an additional Texture layer over the\ngeometry with a uniform alpha scale applied everywhere, if there is at\nleast one available Texture slot available on the multitexture pipeline.\nSet this false to avoid this trickery, so that texturing is only enabled\nwhen the application specifically enables it. See also\ncolor-scale-via-lighting. anim-blend-type enum normalized_linear The default blend type to use for blending animations between\nframes, or between multiple animations. See interpolate-frames, and also\nPartBundle::set_anim_blend_flag() and\nPartBundle::set_frame_blend_flag(). aspect-ratio double 0.0 assert-abort bool 0 Set this true to trigger a core dump and/or stack trace when the\nfirst assertion fails async-bind-priority int 100 This specifies the priority assign to an asynchronous bind task when\nit is requested via PartBundle::load_bind_anim(). This controls the\nrelative order in which asynchronous loads happen (in particular,\nrelative to asynchronous texture or model loads). A higher number here\nmakes the animations load sooner. async-load-delay double 0.0 If this is nonzero, it represents an artificial delay, in seconds,\nthat is imposed on every asynchronous load attempt (within the thread).\nIts purpose is to help debug errors that may occur when an asynchronous\nload is delayed. The delay is per-model, and all aync loads will be\nqueued up behind the delay--it is as if the time it takes to read a file\nis increased by this amount per read. async-request-break-on-timeout bool 0 async-request-num-retries int -1 async-request-timeout double -1.0 asynchronous-clients bool 1 audio-active bool 1 audio-buffering-seconds double 3.0 Controls the amount of audio buffering when streaming audio. If you\nare playing a streaming sound, and any single frame takes longer than\nthis, the audio will stutter. Caution: buffering streaming audio takes a\nlot of memory. For example, 5 seconds of stereo audio at 44,100\nsamples/sec takes one megabyte. The 3-second default is intentionally\nhigh, favoring correctness over efficiency, but for a commercial\napplication you may wish to lower this. audio-cache-limit int 15 The number of sounds in the cache. audio-distance-factor double 1.0 audio-dls-file filename Specifies a DLS file that defines an instrument set to load for MIDI\nfile playback. If this is not specified, the sound interface will try to\nuse the system default DLS file, if one is available; the likely success\nof this depends on the operating system. audio-doppler-factor double 1.0 audio-drop-off-factor double 1.0 audio-library-name string p3openal_audio (from Config.prc); null hardcoded audio-min-hw-channels int 15 Guarantee this many channels on the local sound card, or just play\nEVERYTHING in software. audio-music-active bool 1 DConfig audio-output-bits int 16 audio-output-channels int 2 audio-output-rate int 22050 audio-play-midi bool 1 audio-play-mp3 bool 1 audio-play-wave bool 1 audio-preload-threshold int 1000000 If the decompressed size of a sound file exceeds this amount, then\nPanda3D will not attempt to store that sound file in RAM. Instead, it\nwill stream the sound file from disk. It is not practical to stream\nmultiple sound-files from disk at the same time - the hard drive seek\ntime makes it stutter. audio-sfx-active bool 1 DConfig audio-software-midi bool 1 audio-volume double 1.0 auto-break-cycles bool 1 Set this true to automatically detect and break reference-count\ncycles in the TransformState and RenderState caches. When this is false,\nyou must explicitly call TransformState.clear_cache() from time to time\nto prevent gradual memory bloat. auto-flip bool 0 This indicates the initial setting of the auto-flip flag. Set it\ntrue to cause render_frame() to flip all the windows before it returns\n(in single-threaded mode only), or false to wait until an explicit call\nto flip_frame() or the next render_frame(). Setting it true gets more\nimmediate response time, while setting it false can get a better frame\nrate as more is achieved in parallel with the graphics card. auto-garbage-logging bool 0 DConfig auto-single-cpu-affinity bool 0 DConfig aux-display list Names each of the graphics display libraries that are available on a\nparticular platform. This variable may be repeated several times. These\nlibraries will be tried one at a time if the library specified by\nload_display cannot be loaded. average-frame-rate-interval double 1.0 See ClockObject::set_average_frame_rate_interval(). back-buffers int 1 The default number of back buffers requested. background-color color 0.41 0.41 0.41 0.0 Specifies the rgb(a) value of the default background color for a new\nwindow or offscreen buffer. bam-endian enum littleendian The default endianness to use for writing major numeric data tables\nto bam files. This does not affect all numbers written to bam files,\nonly those for which the individual object was designed to support this\nflag. The default is \"native\"; you may set it to \"littleendian\" or\n\"bigendian\" to target a particular platform. bam-stdfloat-double bool 0 The default width of floating-point numbers to write to a bam file.\nSet this true to force doubles (64-bit floats), or false to force\nsingles (32-bit floats). The default is whichever width Panda has been\ncompiled to use natively. Normally, this setting should not be changed\nfrom the default. bam-texture-mode enum relative Set this to specify how textures should be written into Bam\nfiles.See the panda source or documentation for available options. bam-version int Set this to specify which version .bam files to generate. Each Panda\nversion only supports outputting a limited number of .bam versions. The\ndefault is to use the latest supported version. basic-shaders-only bool #f (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded Set this to true if you aren't interested in shader model three and\nbeyond. Setting this flag will cause panda to disable bleeding-edge\nshader functionality which tends to be unreliable or broken. At some\npoint, when functionality that is currently flaky becomes reliable, we\nmay expand the definition of what constitutes 'basic' shaders. bmp-bpp int 0 This controls how many bits per pixel are written out for BMP files.\nIf this is zero, the default, the number of bits per pixel is based on\nthe image. bounds-type enum sphere Specify the type of bounding volume that is created automatically by\nPanda to enclose geometry. Use 'sphere' or 'box', or use 'best' to let\nPanda decide which is most appropriate. You can also use 'fastest' if\nyou don't want Panda to waste much time computing the most optimal\nbounding volume. buffer-viewer-layout string hline buffer-viewer-position string lrcorner buffer-viewer-size double 0 0 bullet-additional-damping bool 0 Enables additional damping on eachrigid body, in order to reduce\njitter. Default value is FALSE. Additional damping is an experimental\nfeature of the Bullet physics engine. Use with care. bullet-additional-damping-angular-factor double 0.01 Only used when bullet-additional-damping is set to TRUE. Default\nvalue is 0.01 bullet-additional-damping-angular-threshold double 0.01 Only used when bullet-additional-damping is set to TRUE. Default\nvalue is 0.01. bullet-additional-damping-linear-factor double 0.005 Only used when bullet-additional-damping is set to TRUE. Default\nvalue is 0.005 bullet-additional-damping-linear-threshold double 0.01 Only used when bullet-additional-damping is set to TRUE. Default\nvalue is 0.01 bullet-broadphase-algorithm enum aabb Specifies the broadphase algorithm to be used by the physics engine.\nDefault value is 'aabb' (dynamic aabb tree). bullet-enable-contact-events bool 0 Specifies if events should be send when new contacts are created or\nexisting contacts get remove. Warning: enabling contact events might\ncreate more load on the event queue then you might want! Default value\nis FALSE. bullet-filter-algorithm enum mask Specifies the algorithm to be used by the physics engine for\ncollision filtering. Default value is 'mask'. bullet-gc-lifetime int 256 Specifies the lifetime of data clean up be the soft body world info\ngarbage collector. Default value is 256. bullet-max-objects int 1024 Specifies the maximum number of individual objects within a bullet\nphysics world. Default value is 1024. bullet-sap-extents double 1000.0 Specifies the world extent in all directions. The config variable is\nonly used if bullet-broadphase-algorithm is set to 'sap' (sweep and\nprune). Default value is 1000.0. bullet-solver-iterations int 10 Specifies the number of iterations for the Bullet contact solver.\nThis is the native Bullet property btContactSolverInfo::m_numIterations.\nDefault value is 10. ca-bundle-filename filename This names the certificate authority file for OpenSSL to use to\nverify whether SSL certificates are trusted or not. The file named by\nthis setting should contain one or more PEM-formatted certificates from\ntrusted certificate authorities. This is a fairly standard file; a copy\nof ca-bundle.crt is included in the OpenSSL distribution, and is also\nincluded with Panda. cache-check-timestamps bool 1 Set this true to check the timestamps on disk (when possible) before\nreloading a file from the in-memory cache, e.g. via ModelPool,\nTexturePool, etc. When this is false, a model or texture that was\npreviously loaded and is still found in the ModelPool is immediately\nreturned without consulting the disk, even if the file on disk has\nrecently changed. When this is true, the file on disk is always checked\nto ensure its timestamp has not recently changed; and if it has, the\nin-memory cache is automatically invalidated and the file is reloaded\nfrom disk. This is not related to on-disk caching via model-cache-dir,\nwhich always checks the timestamps. cache-generated-shaders bool 1 Set this true to cause all generated shaders to be cached in memory.\nThis is useful to prevent unnecessary recompilation. cache-report bool 0 cache-report-interval double 5.0 cg-glsl-version string If this is set, it forces the Cg compiler to generate GLSL code\nconforming to the given GLSL version when using the glslv, glslf or\nglslg profiles. Use this when you are having problems with these\nprofiles. Example values are 120 or 150. check-debug-notify-protect bool 0 Set true to issue a warning message if a debug or spam notify output\nis not protected within an if statement. client-cpu-affinity int -1 DConfig client-cpu-affinity-mask int -1 DConfig client-log-stack-dump bool 0 DConfig client-sleep double 0.0 DConfig clip-plane-cull bool 1 This is normally true; set it false to disable culling of objects\nthat are completely behind one or more clip planes (primarily useful for\ndebugging) This also disables the use of occluders. clock-degrade-factor double 1.0 In degrade clock mode, returns the ratio by which the performance is\ndegraded. A value of 2.0 causes the clock to be slowed down by a factor\nof two (reducing performance to 1/2 what would be otherwise). See\nClockObject::set_degrade_factor(). clock-frame-rate double 1.0 In non-real-time clock mode, sets the number of frames per second\nthat we should appear to be running. In forced mode or limited mode,\nsets our target frame rate. In normal mode, this has no effect. See\nClockObject::set_frame_rate(). clock-mode enum normal Specifies the mode of the global clock. The default mode, normal, is\na real-time clock; other modes allow non-real-time special effects like\nsimulated reduced frame rate. See ClockObject::set_mode(). cluster-mode string DConfig cluster-sync bool 0 DConfig collect-tcp bool 0 Set this true to enable accumulation of several small consecutive\nTCP datagrams into one large datagram before sending it, to reduce\noverhead from the TCP/IP protocol. See Connection::set_collect_tcp() or\nSocketStream::set_collect_tcp(). collect-tcp-interval double 0.2 collision-parabola-bounds-sample int 10 This is the number of points along a CollisionParabola to sample in\norder to determine an accurate bounding box. collision-parabola-bounds-threshold double 10.0 This is the threshold size for a CollisionParabola to make a\nbounding box (BoundingHexahedron). If the parabola is smaller than this,\nit will make a BoundingSphere instead, which is much easier to make and\nwill be good enough for small parabolas. color-bits int 1 1 1 (from Config.prc); hardcoded The minimum number of total color buffer bits requested. If you\nspecify only one value, it will represent the total value for the red,\ngreen and blue channels, and indicates you don't care how the bits are\ndivided up among the red, green and blue channels. If you specify three\nvalues, it represents three separate red, green and blue bit\nrequirements. color-scale-via-lighting bool 1 When this is true, Panda will try to implement ColorAttribs and\nColorScaleAttribs using the lighting interface, by creating a default\nmaterial and/or an ambient light if necessary, even if lighting is\nostensibly disabled. This avoids the need to munge the vertex data to\nchange each vertex's color. Set this false to avoid this trickery, so\nthat lighting is only enabled when the application specifically enables\nit. See also alpha-scale-via-texture. compose-componentwise bool 1 Set this true to perform componentwise compose and invert operations\nwhen possible. If this is false, the compositions are always computed by\nmatrix. compress-chan-quality int 95 The quality level is an integer number that generally ranges between\n0 and 100, where smaller numbers indicate greater compression at the\ncost of quality, and larger numbers indicate higher quality but less\ncompression. Generally, 95 is the highest useful value; values between\n95 and 100 produce substantially larger, but not substantially better,\noutput files. This is akin to the JPEG compression level. compress-channels bool 0 Set this true to enable lossy compression of animation channels when\nwriting to the bam file. This serves to reduce the size of the bam file\nonly; it does not reduce the memory footprint of the channels when the\nbam file is loaded. compressed-textures bool 0 Set this to true to compress textures as they are loaded into\ntexture memory, if the driver supports this. Specifically, this changes\nthe meaning of set_compression(Texture::CM_default) to\nTexture::CM_on. connect-triangle-strips bool 1 Set this true to send a batch of triangle strips to the graphics\ncard as one long triangle strip, connected by degenerate triangles, or\nfalse to send them as separate triangle strips with no degenerate\ntriangles. On PC hardware, using one long triangle strip may help\nperformance by reducing the number of separate graphics calls that have\nto be made. contents-xml-dl-attempts int 3 Amount of attempts allowed for downloading host data. coordinate-system enum zup_right The default coordinate system to use throughout Panda for rendering,\nuser input, and matrix operations, unless specified otherwise. copy-texture-inverted bool 0 Set this true to indicate that the GSG in use will invert textures\nwhen it performs a framebuffer-to-texture copy operation, or false to\nindicate that it does the right thing. If this is not set, the default\nbehavior is determined by the GSG's internal logic. crdatacache-size int 10 The maximum number of objects to cache data for. cull-bin list gui-popup 60 unsorted (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Creates a new cull bin by name, with the specified properties. This\nis a string in three tokens, separated by whitespace: 'bin_name sort\ntype'. cursor-filename filename cursor-hidden bool 0 dc-multiple-inheritance bool 1 Set this true to support multiple inheritance in the dc file. If\nthis is false, the old way, multiple inheritance is not supported, but\nfield numbers will be numbered sequentially, which may be required to\nsupport old code that assumed this. dc-sort-inheritance-by-file bool 1 This is a temporary hack. This should be true if you are using\nversion 1.42 of the otp_server.exe binary, which sorted inherited fields\nbased on the order of the classes within the DC file, rather than based\non the order in which the references are made within the class. dc-virtual-inheritance bool 1 Set this true to support proper virtual inheritance in the dc file,\nso that diamond-of-death type constructs can be used. This also enables\nshadowing (overloading) of inherited method names from a base\nclass. debug-portal-cull bool 0 Set this true to enable debug visualization during portal\nclipping.(You first need to enable portal culling, using the\nallow-portal-cullvariable.) decompressor-step-time double 0.005 Specifies the maximum amount of time that should be consumed by a\nsingle call to Decompressor::run(). default-antialias-enable bool 0 Set this true to enable the M_auto antialiasing mode for all nodes\nby default. default-converge double 25.0 The default convergence distance for stereo cameras. default-directnotify-level string warning (from Config.prc); info hardcoded default-far double 100000.0 The default far clipping distance for all cameras. default-fov double 30.0 The default field of view in degrees for all cameras. This is\ndefined as a min_fov; that is, it is the field-of-view for the smallest\nof the X and Y sizes of the window, which is usually the vertical field\nof view (windows are usually wider than they are tall). For a 4x3\nwindow, 30 degrees vertical is roughly 40 degrees horizontal. default-iod double 0.2 The default interocular distance for stereo cameras. default-keystone double 0.0 The default keystone correction, as an x y pair, for all\ncameras. default-lod-type enum pop Set this to either 'pop' or 'fade' to determine the type of LODNode\nthat is created by LODNode::make_default_lod(). default-model-extension string .egg (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded This specifies the filename extension (with leading dot) that should\nbe assumed if an attempt is made to load a filename that has no\nextension. This is primarily designed to support legacy code that used\nthe now-deprecated implicit-extension feature of Panda's loader; new\ncode should probably give the correct name for each model file they\nintend to load. default-near double 1.0 The default near clipping distance for all cameras. default-stereo-camera bool 1 When this is true, the default DisplayRegion created for a window or\nbuffer with the stereo property will be a StereoDisplayRegion, which\nactivates the stereo properties of the camera lens, and enables stereo.\nSet this false to require StereoDisplayRegions to be created\nexplicitly. default_max_angular_dt double 0.03333333507180214 default_max_linear_dt double 0.03333333507180214 default_noise_force_seed int 665 default_terminal_velocity double 400.0 depth-bits int 1 (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded The minimum number of depth buffer bits requested. depth-offset-decals bool 1 Set this true to allow decals to be implemented via the advanced\ndepth offset feature, if supported, instead of via the traditional (and\nslower) two-pass approach. This is currently the only method by which\ndecals are implemented in Panda3D, and as such, this setting is\nignored. detect-graph-cycles bool 1 Set this true to attempt to detect cycles in the scene graph (e.g. a\nnode which is its own parent) as soon as they are made. This has no\neffect in NDEBUG mode. dev-run-multiplier double 4.0 Used in DevWalker, which is intended for avatar movement testing.\nThis controls the movement speed of the avatar. direct-gui-edit bool 0 DConfig direct-wtext bool 1 disable-sticky-keys bool 0 DConfig display string Specify the X display string for the default display. If this is not\nspecified, $DISPLAY is used. display-list-animation bool 0 Set this true to allow the use of OpenGL display lists for rendering\nanimated geometry (when the geometry is animated by the hardware). This\nis not on by default because there appear to be some driver issues with\nthis on my FireGL T2, but it should be perfectly doable in principle,\nand might get you a small performance boost. display-lists bool 0 Set this true to allow the use of OpenGL display lists for rendering\nstatic geometry. On some systems, this can result in a performance\nimprovement over vertex buffers alone; on other systems (particularly\nlow-end systems) it makes little to no difference. On some systems,\nusing display lists can actually reduce performance. This has no effect\non DirectX rendering or on dynamic geometry (e.g. soft-skinned\nanimation). download-throttle bool 0 When this is true, all HTTP channels will be bandwidth-limited so as\nnot to consume more than downloader-byte-rate bytes per second. downloader-byte-rate int 500000 Specifies the default max bytes per second of throughput that is\nsupported by any HTTP connections with download-throttle enabled. This\nmay also be set on a per-channel basis with\nHTTPChannel::set_max_bytes_per_second(). It has no effect unless\ndownload-throttle (or HTTPChannel::set_download_throttle) is true. downloader-frequency double 0.2 Frequency of download chunk requests in seconds (or fractions of)\n(Estimated 200 msec round-trip to server). downloader-timeout int 15 downloader-timeout-retries int 5 drive-forward-speed double 20.0 drive-horizontal-center double 0.0 drive-horizontal-dead-zone double 0.1 drive-horizontal-ramp-down-time double 0.0 drive-horizontal-ramp-up-time double 0.0 drive-reverse-speed double 10.0 drive-rotate-speed double 80.0 drive-vertical-center double 0.0 drive-vertical-dead-zone double 0.1 drive-vertical-ramp-down-time double 0.0 drive-vertical-ramp-up-time double 0.0 driver-compress-textures bool 0 Set this true to ask the graphics driver to compress textures,\nrather than compressing them in-memory first. Depending on your graphics\ndriver, you may or may not get better performance or results by setting\nthis true. Setting it true may also allow you to take advantage of some\nexotic compression algorithm other than DXT1/3/5 that your graphics\ndriver supports, but which is unknown to Panda. If the libsquish library\nis not compiled into Panda, textures cannot be compressed in-memory, and\nwill always be handed to the graphics driver, regardless of this\nsetting. driver-generate-mipmaps bool 1 Set this true to use the hardware to generate mipmaps automatically\nin all cases, if supported. Set it false to generate mipmaps in software\nwhen possible. dump-generated-shaders bool 0 Set this true to cause all generated shaders to be written to disk.\nThis is useful for debugging broken shader generators. early-event-sphere bool 0 Set this to true in order to hit door triggers that are just\nslightly behind the door itself. early-random-seed bool 0 Configure this true to compute the SSL random seed early on in the\napplication (specifically, when the libpandaexpress library is loaded),\nor false to defer this until it is actually needed (which will be the\nfirst time you open an https connection or otherwise use encryption\nservices). You can also call HTTPClient::init_random_seed() to do this\nwhen you are ready. The issue is that on Windows, OpenSSL will attempt\nto randomize its seed by crawling through the entire heap of allocated\nmemory, which can be extremely large in a Panda application, especially\nif you have already opened a window and started rendering; and so this\ncan take as much as 30 seconds or more. For this reason it is best to\ninitialize the random seed at startup, when the application is still\nvery small. egg-accept-errors bool 1 When this is true, certain kinds of recoverable errors (not syntax\nerrors) in an egg file will be allowed and ignored when an egg file is\nloaded. When it is false, only perfectly pristine egg files may be\nloaded. egg-alpha-mode enum blend Specifies the alpha mode to apply when the alpha specification \"on\"\nappears in the egg file (or when a primitive is implicitly transparent,\nbecause of a <RGBA> that involves a non-unity alpha, or because of\na four-channel texture. egg-combine-geoms bool 0 Set this true to combine sibling GeomNodes into a single GeomNode,\nwhen possible. This usually shouldn't be necessary, since the egg loader\ndoes a pretty good job of combining these by itself. egg-consider-fans bool 0 Set this true to enable the egg mesher to consider making triangle\nfans out of triangles that are connected at a common vertex. This may\nhelp if your scene involves lots of such connected triangles, but it can\nalso make the overall stripping less effective (by interfering with\ntriangle strips). egg-coordinate-system enum default egg-coplanar-threshold double 0.01 The numerical threshold below which polygons are considered to be\ncoplanar. Determined empirically. egg-emulate-bface bool 1 When this is true, the bface flag applied to a polygon will cause\ntwo different polygons to be created, back-to-back. When it is false, a\nsingle polygon will be created with the two_sided flag set on it. egg-flat-colors bool 1 Set this true to allow the egg loader to create geometry with the\nColorAttrib::T_flat attribute set: that is, geometry that uses the scene\ngraph color instead of per-vertex color. Normally Panda will do this as\nan optimization for Geoms whose vertices are all the same color, or all\nwhite. This allows the removal of the color attribute from the vertices\nwhere it is not necessary to specify colors per-vertex. If this is\nfalse, the color attribute will always be specified per-vertex, even if\nall vertices have the same value. egg-flat-shading bool 0 Set this true to allow the egg loader to create geometry with the\nShadeModelAttrib::M_flat attribute set. It will do this only for\ngeometry that has per-polygon normals and/or colors. This allows the egg\nloader to avoid duplicating vertices when they are shared between\nconnected polygons with different normals or colors, but it prevents the\nflat-shaded geometry from being combined with any adjacent smooth-shaded\ngeometry (for instance, as the result of a flatten_strong operation). It\nis false by default, since flat-shaded geometry is rare; but you may\nwish to set it true if your scene largely or entirely consists of\nflat-shaded polygons. egg-flatten bool 1 This is normally true to flatten out useless nodes after loading an\negg file. Set it false if you want to see the complete and true\nhierarchy as the egg loader created it (although the extra nodes may\nhave a small impact on render performance). egg-flatten-radius double 0.0 This specifies the minimum cull radius in the egg file. Nodes whose\nbounding volume is smaller than this radius will be flattened tighter\nthan nodes larger than this radius, to reduce the node count even\nfurther. The idea is that small objects will not need to have their\nindividual components culled separately, but large environments should.\nThis allows the user to specify what should be considered \"small\". Set\nit to 0.0 to disable this feature. egg-ignore-decals bool 0 egg-ignore-filters bool 0 egg-ignore-mipmaps bool 0 egg-implicit-alpha-binary bool 0 If this is true, then a <Scalar> alpha value appearing in an\negg file that appears to specify only a binary (0 or 1) value for alpha\nwill automatically be downgraded to alpha type \"binary\" instead of\nwhatever appears in the egg file. egg-load-classic-nurbs-curves bool 0 When this is true (and the above is also true), a <NurbsCurve>\nentry appearing in an egg file will load a ClassicNurbsCurve object\ninstead of the default, a NurbsCurve object. This only makes a\ndifference when the NURBS++ library is available, in which case the\ndefault, NurbsCurve, is actually a NurbsPPCurve object. egg-load-old-curves bool 1 When this is true, a <NurbsCurve> entry appearing in an egg\nfile will load as a NurbsCurve or ClassicNurbsCurve object (see below).\nWhen this is false, it will load a RopeNode instead, which uses the new\nNurbsCurveEvaluator interface. egg-max-indices int 65535 Specifies the maximum number of vertex indices that will be added to\nany one GeomPrimitive by the egg loader. egg-max-tfan-angle double 40.0 The maximum average angle per triangle to allow in a triangle fan.\nIf triangles are larger than this--that is, more loosely packed--then we\nfigure a triangle strip is likely to do a more effective job than a\ntriangle fan, and the fan maker leaves it alone. egg-max-vertices int 65534 Specifies the maximum number of vertices that will be added to any\none GeomVertexData by the egg loader. egg-mesh bool 1 Set this true to convert triangles and higher-order polygons into\ntriangle strips and triangle fans when an egg file is loaded or\nconverted to bam. Set this false just to triangulate everything into\nindependent triangles. egg-min-tfan-tris int 4 The minimum number of triangles that must be involved in order to\ngenerate a triangle fan. Fewer than this is just interrupting a triangle\nstrip. egg-normal-scale double 1.0 egg-object-type-barrier string <Collide> { Polyset descend } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-binary string <Scalar> alpha { binary } (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-bubble string <Collide> { Sphere keep descend } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-dcs string <DCS> { 1 } (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-direct-widget string <Scalar> collide-mask { 0x80000000 } <Collide> { Polyset\ndescend } (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-dual string <Scalar> alpha { dual } (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-dupefloor string <Collide> { Polyset keep descend level } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-floor string <Collide> { Polyset descend level } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-ghost string <Scalar> collide-mask { 0 } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-glass string <Scalar> alpha { blend_no_occlude } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-glow string <Scalar> blend { add } (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-indexed string <Scalar> indexed { 1 } (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-invsphere string <Collide> { InvSphere descend } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-model string <Model> { 1 } (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-notouch string <DCS> { no_touch } (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-polylight string <Scalar> polylight { 1 } (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-portal string <Scalar> portal { 1 } (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-seq10 string <Switch> { 1 } <Scalar> fps { 10 } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-seq12 string <Switch> { 1 } <Scalar> fps { 12 } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-seq2 string <Switch> { 1 } <Scalar> fps { 2 } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-seq24 string <Switch> { 1 } <Scalar> fps { 24 } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-seq4 string <Switch> { 1 } <Scalar> fps { 4 } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-seq6 string <Switch> { 1 } <Scalar> fps { 6 } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-seq8 string <Switch> { 1 } <Scalar> fps { 8 } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-sphere string <Collide> { Sphere descend } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-trigger string <Collide> { Polyset descend intangible } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-trigger-sphere string <Collide> { Sphere descend intangible } (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-object-type-tube string <Collide> { Tube descend } (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded Defines egg syntax for the named object type. egg-precision int 15 The number of digits of precision to write out for values in an egg\nfile. Leave this at 0 to use the default setting for the stream. egg-preload-simple-textures bool 1 This specifies whether the egg loader will generate simple texture\nimages for each texture loaded. This supercedes the\npreload-simple-textures global default, for egg files. In fact, the egg\nloader will generate simple texture images if either this or\npreload-simple-textures is true. egg-recursion-limit int 1000 The maximum number of levels that recursive algorithms within the\negg library are allowed to traverse. This is a simple hack to prevent\ndeeply-recursive algorithms from triggering a stack overflow. Set it\nlarger to run more efficiently if your stack allows it; set it lower if\nyou experience stack overflows. egg-retesselate-coplanar bool 0 If this is true, the egg loader may reverse the tesselation\ndirection of a single pair of planar triangles that share the same\nproperties, if that will help get a better triangle strip. In some rare\ncases, doing so can distort the UV's on a face; turning this off should\neliminate that artifact (at the cost of less-effective triangle\nstripping). egg-rigid-geometry bool 0 Set this true to create rigid pieces of an animated character as\nseparate static nodes, or false to leave these in with the parent node\nas vertex-animated geometry. Setting this true means less geometry has\nto be vertex-animated, but there will tend to be more separate\npieces. egg-show-normals bool 0 egg-show-qsheets bool 0 Set this true to color each quadsheet a random color, so you can\nvisually observe the quadsheet algorithm. egg-show-quads bool 0 Set this true to color each detected quad a random color, so you can\nvisually observe the algorithm that unifies pairs of triangles into\nquads (prior to generating triangle strips). egg-show-tstrips bool 0 Set this true to color each triangle strip a random color, with the\nleading triangle a little bit darker, so you can visually observe the\nquality of the triangle stripping algorithm. egg-subdivide-polys bool 1 This is obsolete. In the old Geom implementation, it used to be true\nto force higher-order polygons that were not otherwise meshed to be\nsubdivided into triangles. In the new Geom implementation, this happens\nanyway. egg-support-old-anims bool 1 Set this true to support loading of old character animation files,\nwhich had the convention that the order \"phr\" implied a reversed\nroll. egg-suppress-hidden bool 0 When this is true, objects flagged as \"hidden\" with the visibility\nscalar are not created at all. When false, these objects are created,\nbut initially stashed. egg-test-vref-integrity int 20 The maximum number of vertices a primitive may have before its\nvertices will no longer be checked for internal integrity. This is\nmeaningful in non-production builds only. egg-unify bool 1 When this is true, then in addition to flattening the scene graph\nnodes, the egg loader will also combine as many Geoms as possible within\na given node into a single Geom. This has theoretical performance\nbenefits, especially on higher-end graphics cards, but it also slightly\nslows down egg loading. egg-unroll-fans bool 1 Set this true to allow the egg loader to convert weak triangle\nfans--triangles that share the same vertex but aren't connected enough\nto justify making a triangle fan primitive from them--into a series of\nzig-zag triangles that can make a triangle strip that might connect\nbetter with its neighbors. egg-vertex-max-num-joints int 4 Specifies the maximum number of distinct joints that are allowed to\ncontrol any one vertex. If a vertex requests assignment to more than\nthis number of joints, the joints with the lesser membership value are\nignored. Set this to -1 to allow any number of joints. egg-vertex-membership-quantize double 0.1 Specifies the nearest amount to round each vertex joint membership\nvalue when loading an egg file. This affects animated egg files only.\nThere is a substantial runtime performance advantage for reducing\ntrivial differences in joint membership. Set this to 0 to leave joint\nmembership as it is. enforce-attrib-lock bool 1 When a MaterialAttrib, TextureAttrib, or LightAttrib is constructed,\nthe corresponding Material, Texture, or Light is 'attrib locked.' The\nattrib lock prevents qualitative changes to the object. This makes it\npossible to hardwire information about material, light, and texture\nproperties into generated shaders. This config variable can disable the\nattrib lock. Disabling the lock will break the shader generator, but\ndoing so may be necessary for backward compatibility with old code. even-animation bool 0 When this is true, characters' vertices will be recomputed every\nframe, whether they need it or not. This will tend to balance out the\nframe rate so that it is more uniformly slow. The default is to compute\nvertices only when they need to be computed, which can lead to an uneven\nframe rate. exclude-texture-scale list This is a list of glob patterns for texture filenames (excluding the\ndirectory part of the filename, but including the extension); for\ninstance, 'digits_*.png'. Any texture filenames that match one of these\npatterns will not be affected by max-texture-dimension or\ntexture-scale. extended-exceptions bool 0 extractor-step-time double 0.005 Specifies the maximum amount of time that should be consumed by a\nsingle call to Extractor::step(). fake-texture-image filename Set this to enable a speedy-load mode in which you don't care what\nthe world looks like, you just want it to load in minimal time. This\ncauses all texture loads via the TexturePool to use the same texture\nfile, which will presumably only be loaded once. fake-view-frustum-cull bool 0 Set this true to cause culling to be performed by rendering the\nobject in red wireframe, rather than actually culling it. This helps\nmake culling errors obvious. This variable only has an effect when Panda\nis not compiled for a release build. ffmpeg-global-lock bool 0 Set this true to enable a single global mutex across *all* ffmpeg\noperations. Leave this false to use the mutex only for the ffmpeg\noperations that are generally known to be not thread-safe. This will\nnegatively affect ffmpeg performance, especially when decoding multiple\nvideos at once (including the left and right channels of a stereo\nvideo). Set this true only if you suspect a problem with ffmpeg's own\nthread-safe nature. ffmpeg-max-readahead-frames int 2 The maximum number of frames ahead which an ffmpeg decoder thread\nshould read in advance of actual playback. Set this to 0 to decode\nffmpeg videos in the main thread. ffmpeg-read-buffer-size int 4096 The size in bytes of the buffer used when reading input files. This\nis important for performance. A typical size is that of a cache page,\ne.g. 4kb. ffmpeg-show-seek-frames bool 1 Set this true to allow showing the intermediate results of seeking\nthrough the ffmpeg stream to a target frame, or false to hold the\ncurrent frame until the target frame is achieved. This has the biggest\neffect on videos that are too expensive to decode in real time: when\nthis is true, the video can be seen to animate at least a little bit;\nwhen it is false, you may get long periods of one held frame. ffmpeg-support-seek bool 1 True to use the av_seek_frame() function to seek within ffmpeg video\nfiles. If this is false, Panda will only seek within a file by reading\nit from the beginning until the desired point, which can be much slower.\nSet this false only if you suspect a problem with av_seek_frame(). ffmpeg-thread-priority enum normal The default thread priority at which to start ffmpeg decoder\nthreads. fft-error-threshold double 0.2 fft-exponent double 4.0 fft-factor double 0.1 fft-offset double 0.001 filesystem-encoding enum utf8 Specifies the default encoding used for wide-character\nfilenames. flash-bin-background color flash-bin-fixed color flash-bin-gui-popup color flash-bin-opaque color flash-bin-transparent color flash-bin-unsorted color flatten-collision-nodes bool 0 Set this true to allow NodePath::flatten_medium() and\nflatten_strong() to combine multiple CollisionNodes into a single\nCollisionNode--but only if they share the same name and collide masks.\nWhen false, CollisionNodes are never combined. This is false by default,\nsince collision tests rely heavily on bounding volume tests to be\nefficient, and combining CollisionNodes is likely to merge bounding\nvolumes inappropriately. flatten-geoms bool 1 When this is true (the default), NodePath::flatten_strong() and\nflatten_medium() will attempt to combine multiple Geoms into as few\nGeoms as possible, by combing GeomVertexDatas and then unifying. Setting\nthis false disables this behavior, so that NodePath flatten operations\nwill only reduce nodes. This affects only the NodePath interfaces; you\nmay still make the lower-level SceneGraphReducer calls directly. flt-error-abort bool 0 Set this true to trigger an assertion failure (and core dump)\nimmediately when an error is detected on reading or writing a flt file.\nThis is primarily useful for debugging the flt reader itself, to\ngenerate a stack trace to determine precisely at what point a flt file\nfailed. fluid-cap-amount int 100 ensures that fluid pos doesn't check beyond X feet fmod-audio-preload-threshold int 1048576 Files that are smaller than this number of bytes will be preloaded\nand kept resident in memory, while files that are this size or larger\nwill be streamed from disk. Set this to -1 to preload every file. fmod-number-of-sound-channels int 128 Guarantee this many channels you will have with FMOD. AKA the max\nnumber of sounds you can play at one time. fmod-speaker-mode enum Sets the speaker configuration that the FMOD sound system will use.\nOptions: raw, mono, stereo, quad, surround, 5.1 and 7.1. fmod-use-surround-sound bool 0 Determines if an FMOD Flavor of PANDA use 5.1 Surround Sound or not.\nThis variable is deprecated and should not be used. Use the enum\nvariable fmod-speaker-mode instead. force-parasite-buffer bool 0 Set this true to make GraphicsOutput::make_texture_buffer() really\nstrongly prefer ParasiteBuffers over conventional offscreen buffers.\nWith this set, it will create a ParasiteBuffer every time an offscreen\nbuffer is requested, even if this means reducing the buffer size to fit\nwithin the window. The only exceptions are for buffers that, by their\nnature, really cannot use ParasiteBuffers (like depth textures). You\nmight set this true if you don't trust your graphics driver's support\nfor offscreen buffers. force-pstatcollect bool 0 Set this to true to force PStats to run. frame-rate-meter-layer-sort int 1000 frame-rate-meter-milliseconds bool 0 frame-rate-meter-ms-text-pattern string %0.1f ms frame-rate-meter-scale double 0.05 frame-rate-meter-side-margins double 0.5 frame-rate-meter-text-pattern string %0.1f fps frame-rate-meter-update-interval double 1.5 framebuffer-accum bool 0 True if FM_accum should be added to the default framebuffer\nproperties, which requests an accumulator buffer if possible. framebuffer-alpha bool 1 True if FM_alpha should be added to the default framebuffer\nproperties, which requests an alpha channel if possible. framebuffer-depth bool 1 True if FM_depth should be added to the default framebuffer\nproperties, which requests a depth buffer. framebuffer-float bool 0 Set this to request a framebuffer that uses floating-point storage\nfor the color channel. framebuffer-hardware bool #t (from Config.prc); 1 hardcoded True if FM_hardware should be added to the default framebuffer\nproperties, which requests a hardware-accelerated display. framebuffer-mode string No longer has any effect. Do not use. framebuffer-multisample bool 0 True if FM_multisample should be added to the default framebuffer\nproperties, which requests a multisample-capable display, if possible.\nThis can be used to implement full-screen antialiasing. framebuffer-software bool #f (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded True if FM_software should be added to the default framebuffer\nproperties, which requests a software-only display. framebuffer-srgb bool 0 Set this to request an sRGB framebuffer, which will convert all\nvalues to linear space before blending. This means that the output will\nbe properly gamma-corrected, as long as all the input textures are\neither converted from original sRGB to linear or sRGB textures are\nused. framebuffer-stencil bool 0 True if FM_stencil should be added to the default framebuffer\nproperties, which requests an stencil buffer if possible. framebuffer-stereo bool 0 True if FM_stereo should be added to the default framebuffer\nproperties, which requests a stereo-capable display, if supported by the\ngraphics driver. fullscreen bool #f (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded game-server-timeout-ms int 20000 This represents the amount of time to block waiting for the TCP\nconnection to the game server. It is only used when the connection\nmethod is NSPR. garbage-collect-states bool 1 Set this true to defer destruction of TransformState and RenderState\nobjects until the end of the frame (or whenever\nTransformState::garbage_collect() and RenderState::garbage_collect() are\ncalled). This is a particularly useful thing to do when using multiple\nthreads, because it improves parallelization. garbage-collect-states-rate double 1.0 The fraction of the total number of TransformStates (or\nRenderStates, or whatever) that are processed with each garbage\ncollection step. Setting this smaller than 1.0 will collect fewer states\neach frame, which may require less processing time, but risks getting\nunstable cache performance if states accumulate faster than they can be\ncleaned up. geom-cache-min-frames int 1 Specifies the minimum number of frames any one particular object\nwill remain in the geom cache, even if geom-cache-size is exceeded. geom-cache-size int 5000 Specifies the maximum number of entries in the cache for storing\npre-processed data for rendering vertices. This limit is flexible, and\nmay be temporarily exceeded if many different Geoms are pre-processed\nduring the space of a single frame. geomipterrain-incorrect-normals bool 0 If true, uses the incorrect normal vector calculation that was used\nin Panda3D versions 1.9 and earlier. If false (the default), uses the\ncorrect calculation. gl-cheap-textures bool 0 Configure this true to glHint the textures into the cheapest\npossible mode. gl-check-errors bool 0 Regularly call glGetError() to check for OpenGL errors. This will\nslow down rendering significantly. If your video driver supports it, you\nshould use gl-debug instead. gl-color-mask bool 1 Configure this false if your GL's implementation of glColorMask() is\nbroken (some are). This will force the use of a (presumably) more\nexpensive blending operation instead. gl-compile-and-execute bool 0 Configure this true if you know your GL's implementation of\nglNewList(n, GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE) works. It is false by default,\nsince it is known to cause a crash with Intel 855GM driver 4.14.10.3889\nat least. Turning this on *may* reduce the chug you get for preparing\ndisplay lists for the first time, by allowing the display list to be\nrendered at the same time it is being compiled. gl-coordinate-system enum yup_right Which coordinate system to use as the internal coordinate system for\nOpenGL operations. If you are using features like fixed-function sphere\nmapping, it is best to leave this to yup-right. However, if you are\ncreating a shader-only application, it may be easier and more efficient\nto set this to default. gl-cube-map-seamless bool 1 This configures Panda to try and enable seamless cube map sampling\nwhen supported. This will help to remove seams that show up at cube map\nedges, especially at lower resolutions. On by default; disable if you\nsuspect that this is causing problems or if you simply don't need the\nfunctionality. gl-debug bool 0 Setting this to true will cause OpenGL to emit more useful error and\ndebug messages, at a slight runtime performance cost. notify-level-glgsg\ncontrols which severity levels are shown. gl-debug-abort-level enum fatal Set this to a setting other than 'fatal' to cause an abort to be\ntriggered when an error of the indicated severity level (or a more\nsevere one) occurs. This is useful if you want to attach a debugger. If\nyou set this, it is highly recommended to also set gl-debug-synchronous,\nsince the call stack will otherwise not point to the GL call that\ntriggered the error message. This feature is not available when NDEBUG\nhas been defined. gl-debug-buffers bool 0 Set this true, in addition to enabling debug notify for glgsg, to\nenable debug messages about the creation and destruction of OpenGL\nvertex buffers. gl-debug-object-labels bool 1 When gl-debug is set to true, this will tell OpenGL the name of\ntextures, shaders, and other objects, so that OpenGL can display those\nin error messages. There's usually no reason to disable this. gl-debug-synchronous bool 0 Set this true to make sure that the errors generated by gl-debug are\nreported as soon as they happen. This is highly recommended if you want\nto attach a debugger since the call stack may otherwise not point to the\nGL call where the error originated. gl-dump-compiled-shaders bool 0 This configures Panda to dump the binary content of GLSL programs to\ndisk with a filename like glsl_program0.dump into the current\ndirectory. gl-enable-memory-barriers bool 1 If this is set, Panda will make sure that every write to an image\nusing an image2D (et al) binding will cause Panda to issue a memory\nbarrier before the next use of said texture, to ensure that all reads\nand writes are properly synchronized. This may not be strictly necessary\nwhen using the 'coherent' qualifier, but Panda has no way to detect\nwhether you are using those. Turning this off may give a slight\nperformance increase, but you have to know what you're doing. gl-finish bool 0 Set this true to force a call to glFinish() after every major\ngraphics operation. This is likely to slow down rendering performance\nsubstantially, but it will make PStats graphs more accurately reflect\nwhere the graphics bottlenecks are, although it is better to use timer\nqueries when available. This variable is enabled only if PStats is\ncompiled in. gl-fixed-vertex-attrib-locations bool 0 Experimental feature. gl-force-depth-stencil bool 0 Temporary hack variable 7x00 vs 8x00 nVidia bug. See\nglGraphicsStateGuardian_src.cxx. gl-force-fbo-color bool 1 This is set to true to force all FBOs to have at least one color\nattachment. This is to work around an Intel driver issue. Set to false\nto allow depth-only FBOs. gl-force-flush bool 0 Call this to force a call to glFlush() after rendering a frame, even\nwhen using a double-buffered framebuffer. This can incur a significant\nperformance penalty. gl-force-mipmaps bool 0 Configure this true to enable full trilinear mipmapping on every\ntexture, whether it asks for it or not. gl-ignore-clamp bool 0 Configure this true to disable texture clamp mode (all textures\nrepeat, a little cheaper for software renderers). gl-ignore-filters bool 0 Configure this true to disable any texture filters at all (forcing\npoint sampling). gl-ignore-mipmaps bool 0 Configure this true to disable mipmapping only. gl-immutable-texture-storage bool 0 This configures Panda to pre-allocate immutable storage for each\ntexture. This improves runtime performance, but changing the size or\ntype of a texture will be slower. gl-interleaved-arrays bool 0 Set this true to convert OpenGL geometry such that the primary data\ncolumns vertex, normal, color, and texcoord are interleaved into one\narray when possible, or false to render geometry as it appears in the\nGeomVertexData. See also gl-parallel-arrays. gl-max-errors int 20 This is the limit on the number of OpenGL errors Panda will detect\nand report before it shuts down rendering. Set it to -1 for no\nlimit. gl-min-buffer-usage-hint enum stream This specifies the first usage hint value that will be loaded as a\nvertex buffer, instead of directly from the client. Normally, this\nshould be \"stream\", which means to load the vertex buffer using\nGL_STREAM_DRAW. If this is set to \"dynamic\", or \"static\", then only\nusage hints at that level or higher will be loaded as a vertex buffer,\nand stream or lower will be rendered directly from the client array. If\nchanging this results in a remarkable performance improvement, you may\nhave code that is creating and destroying vertex buffers every frame,\ninstead of reusing the same buffers. Consider increasing\nreleased-vbuffer-cache-size instead. gl-parallel-arrays bool 0 Set this true to convert OpenGL geometry such that each data column\nis a separate array, or false to render geometry as it appears in the\nGeomVertexData. See also gl-interleaved-arrays. gl-separate-specular-color bool 1 When separate specular mode is on, the specular component will be\nwritten to the secondary instead of the primary color, which is added\nafter the texturing stage. In other words, the specular highlight will\nbe unmodulated by the color of the texture. gl-show-texture-usage bool 0 If you set this true, the screen will flash with textures drawn in a\nspecial mode that shows the mipmap detail level and texture size for\neach texture. Textures will be drawn in blue for mipmap level 0, yellow\nfor mipmap level 1, and red for all higher mipmap levels. Brighter\ncolors represent larger textures. gl-show-texture-usage-max-size int 1024 Specifies the texture size (along one side) of the largest texture\nexpected to be loaded. This controls the assignment of the texture color\nin gl-show-texture-usage mode; colors will be fully bright for textures\nof this size or larger. gl-support-clamp-to-border bool 1 Configure this true to enable the use of the clamp_to_border\nextension if the GL claims to support it, or false not to use it even if\nit appears to be available. (On some OpenGL drivers, enabling this mode\ncan force software rendering.) gl-support-fbo bool 1 Configure this false if your GL's implementation of\nEXT_framebuffer_object is broken. The system might still be able to\ncreate buffers using pbuffers or the like. gl-support-occlusion-query bool 1 Configure this true to enable the use of the occlusion_query\nextension if the GL claims to support it, or false not to use it even if\nit appears to be available. (On some OpenGL drivers, enabling this mode\ncan force software rendering.) gl-support-primitive-restart-index bool 1 Setting this causes Panda to make use of primitive restart indices\nto more efficiently render line segment primitives. Set to false if you\nsuspect a bug in the driver implementation. gl-support-rescale-normal bool 1 Configure this true to enable the use of the rescale_normal\nextension if the GL claims to support it, or false not to use it even if\nit appears to be available. (This appears to be buggy on some\ndrivers.) gl-support-sampler-objects bool 1 Setting this allows Panda to make use of sampler objects. Set to\nfalse if you suspect a bug in the driver implementation. gl-support-shadow-filter bool 1 Disable this if you suspect a bug in the driver implementation of\nARB_shadow. Particularly, older ATI cards suffered from a broken\nimplementation of the shadow map filtering features. gl-support-texture-lod bool 1 Configure this true to enable the use of minmax LOD settings and\ntexture LOD bias settings. Set this to false if you suspect a driver\nbug. gl-use-bindless-texture bool 0 Set this to let Panda use OpenGL's bindless texture extension for\nall textures passed to shaders, for improved performance. This is an\nexperimental feature and comes with a few caveats; for one, it requires\nthat all sampler uniforms have a layout(bindless_sampler) qualifier, and\nit also requires that the texture properties are not modified after the\ntexture handle has been initialized. gl-validate-shaders bool 1 Set this to true to enable glValidateShader the first time a shader\nis bound. This may cause helpful information about shaders to be\nprinted. gl-version int Set this to get an OpenGL context with a specific version. gl-vertex-array-objects bool 1 Setting this causes Panda to make use of vertex array objects to\nmore efficiently switch between sets of vertex arrays. This only has\neffect when vertex-arrays and vertex-buffers are both set. This should\nusually be true unless you suspect a bug in the implementation. glsl-include-recursion-limit int 10 This sets a limit on how many nested #pragma include directives that\nPanda will follow when glsl-preprocess is enabled. This is used to\nprevent infinite recursion when two shader files include each\nother. glsl-preprocess bool 1 If this is enabled, Panda looks for lines starting with #pragma\ninclude when loading a GLSL shader and processes it appropriately. This\ncan be useful if you have code that is shared between multiple shaders.\nSet this to false if you have no need for this feature or if you do your\nown preprocessing of GLSL shaders. glx-get-os-address bool 1 Set this to true to allow Panda to query the OpenGL library directly\nusing standard operating system calls to locate addresses of extension\nfunctions. This will be done only if glxGetProcAddress() cannot be used\nfor some reason. glx-get-proc-address bool 1 Set this to true to allow the use of glxGetProcAddress(), if it is\navailable, to query the OpenGL extension functions. This is the standard\nway to query extension functions. glx-support-fbconfig bool 1 Set this true to enable the use of the advanced FBConfig interface\n(as opposed to the older XVisual interface) if it is available, to\nselect a graphics visual and create an OpenGL context. glx-support-pbuffer bool 1 Set this true to enable the use of X pbuffer-based offscreen\nbuffers, if available. This is usually preferred over pixmap-based\nbuffers, but not all drivers support them. glx-support-pixmap bool 0 Set this true to enable the use of X pixmap-based offscreen buffers.\nThis is false by default because pixmap-based buffers are usually slower\nthan pbuffer-based buffers. graphics-memory-limit int -1 This is a default limit that is imposed on each GSG at GSG creation\ntime. It limits the total amount of graphics memory, including texture\nmemory and vertex buffer memory, that will be consumed by the GSG,\nregardless of whether the hardware claims to provide more graphics\nmemory than this. It is useful to put a ceiling on graphics memory\nconsumed, since some drivers seem to allow the application to consume\nmore memory than the hardware can realistically support. Set this to -1\nto have no limit other than the normal hardware-imposed limit. handle-datagrams-internally bool 1 When this is true, certain datagram types can be handled directly by\nthe C++ cConnectionRepository implementation, for performance reasons.\nWhen it is false, all datagrams are handled by the Python\nimplementation. hardware-animated-vertices bool #f (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded Set this true to allow the transforming of soft-skinned animated\nvertices via hardware, if supported, or false always to perform the\nvertex animation via software within Panda. If you have a card that\nsupports this, and your scene does not contain too many vertices\nalready, this can provide a performance boost by offloading some work\nfrom your CPU onto your graphics card. It may also help by reducing the\nbandwidth necessary on your computer's bus. However, in some cases it\nmay actually reduce performance. hardware-point-sprites bool 1 Set this true to allow the use of hardware extensions when rendering\nperspective-scaled points and point sprites. When false, these large\npoints are always simulated via quads computed in software, even if the\nhardware claims it can support them directly. hardware-points bool 1 Set this true to allow the use of hardware extensions when rendering\nlarge points. When false, large points (even if untextured) will be\nsimulated via quads computed in software. http-connect-timeout double 10.0 This is the default amount of time to wait for a TCP/IP connection\nto be established, in seconds. http-idle-timeout double 5.0 This the amount of time, in seconds, in which a\npreviously-established connection is allowed to remain open and unused.\nIf a previous connection has remained unused for at least this number of\nseconds, it will be closed and a new connection will be opened;\notherwise, the same connection will be reused for the next request (for\na particular HTTPChannel). http-max-connect-count int 10 This is the maximum number of times to try reconnecting to the\nserver on any one document attempt. This is just a failsafe to prevent\nthe code from attempting runaway connections; this limit should never be\nreached in practice. http-proxy-tunnel bool 0 This specifies the default value for\nHTTPChannel::set_proxy_tunnel(). If this is true, we will tunnel through\na proxy for all connections, instead of asking the proxy to serve\ndocuments normally. http-skip-body-size int 8192 This is the maximum number of bytes in a received (but unwanted)\nbody that will be skipped past, in order to reset to a new request. See\nHTTPChannel::set_skip_body_size(). http-timeout double 20.0 This is the default amount of time to wait for the HTTP server (or\nproxy) to finish sending its response to our request, in seconds. It\nstarts counting after the TCP connection has been established\n(http_connect_timeout, above) and the request has been sent. icon-filename filename img-header-type enum short IMG format is just a sequential string of r, g, b bytes. However, it\nmay or may not include a \"header\" which consists of the xsize and the\nysize of the image, either as shorts or as longs. Specify that with this\nvariable, either 'short', 'long', or 'none' for no header at all (in\nwhich case you should also set img-size). img-size int 0 If an IMG file without a header is loaded (e.g. img-header-type is\nset to 'none', this specifies the fixed x y size of the image. inactivity-timeout double 0.0 interest-debug bool 0 When set to true, becomes verbose and returns debug information for\nDoInterestManager. interpolate-frames bool 0 Set this true to interpolate character animations between frames, or\nfalse to hold each frame until the next one is ready. This can also be\nchanged on a per-character basis with\nPartBundle::set_frame_blend_flag(). interrogatedb-path search-path The search path for interrogate's *.in files. interval-precision double 1000.0 Set this to the default value for set_precision() for each\nCMetaInterval created. jpeg-quality int 95 Set this to the quality percentage for writing JPEG files. 95 is the\nhighest useful value (values greater than 95 do not lead to\nsignificantly better quality, but do lead to significantly greater\nsize). keep-temporary-files bool 0 Set this true to keep around the temporary files from downloading,\ndecompressing, and patching, or false (the default) to delete these.\nMainly useful for debugging when the process goes wrong. keep-texture-ram bool 0 Set this to true to retain the ram image for each texture after it\nhas been prepared with the GSG. This will allow the texture to be\nprepared with multiple GSG's, or to be re-prepared later after it is\nexplicitly released from the GSG, without having to reread the texture\nimage from disk; but it will consume memory somewhat wastefully. lens-far-limit double 1e-7 This number is used to reduce the effect of numeric inaccuracies in\nLens::extrude(). It should be a very small, positive number, almost\nzero; set it larger if Lens::extrude() returns values that appear\nmeaningless, and set it smaller if you appear to be unable to move the\nfar plane out far enough. lens-geom-segments int 50 This is the number of times to subdivide the visualization wireframe\ncreated when Lens::make_geometry() (or LensNode::show_frustum()) is\ncalled, for representing accurate curves. Note that this is only used\nfor a nonlinear lens such as a cylindrical or fisheye lens; for a normal\nperspective or orthographic lens, the wireframe is not subdivided. load-audio-type list * p3ffmpeg (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded List the audio loader modules that Panda will automatically import\nwhen a new, unknown audio type is loaded. This may be either the name of\na module, or a space-separate list of filename extensions, followed by\nthe name of the module. load-display string pandagl (from Config.prc); * hardcoded Specify the name of the default graphics display library or\nGraphicsPipe to load. It is the name of a shared library (or * for all\nlibraries named in aux-display), optionally followed by the name of the\nparticular GraphicsPipe class to create. load-file-type list egg pandaegg (from Confauto.prc); p3ptloader (from Confauto.prc);\nhardcoded List the model loader modules that Panda will automatically import\nwhen a new, unknown model type is loaded. This may be either the name of\na module, or a space-separate list of filename extensions, followed by\nthe name of the module. load-video-type list * p3ffmpeg (from Confauto.prc); hardcoded List the video loader modules that Panda will automatically import\nwhen a new, unknown video type is loaded. This may be either the name of\na module, or a space-separate list of filename extensions, followed by\nthe name of the module. loader-num-threads int 1 The number of threads that will be started by the Loader class to\nload models asynchronously. These threads will only be started if the\nasynchronous interface is used, and if threading support is compiled\ninto Panda. The default is one thread, which allows models to be loaded\none at a time in a single asychronous thread. You can set this higher,\nparticularly if you have many CPU's available, to allow loading multiple\nmodels simultaneously. loader-support-entry-points bool 0 Used in the Loader class. When set to true, the loader will\nadditionally load python packages. loader-thread-priority enum low The default thread priority to assign to the threads created for\nasynchronous loading. The default is 'low'; you may also specify\n'normal', 'high', or 'urgent'. lod-fade-bin-draw-order int 0 The default bin draw order to assign the fading part of a\nFadeLODNode transition. lod-fade-bin-name string fixed The default bin name in which to place the fading part of a\nFadeLODNode transition. lod-fade-state-override int 1000 The default override value to assign to the fade attribs in order to\neffect a FadeLODNode transition. lod-fade-time double 0.5 The default amount of time (in seconds) over which a FadeLODNode\ntransitions between its different levels. log-stack-dump bool 0 DConfig m-dual bool 1 Set this false to disable TransparencyAttrib::M_dual altogether (and\nuse M_alpha in its place). m-dual-flash bool 0 Set this true to flash any objects that use M_dual, for\ndebugging. m-dual-opaque bool 1 Set this false to disable just the opaque part of M_dual. m-dual-transparent bool 1 Set this false to disable just the transparent part of M_dual. matrix-palette bool 0 Set this true to allow the use of the matrix palette when animating\nvertices in hardware. The matrix palette is not supported by all\ndevices, but if it is, using it can allow animation of more\nsophisticated meshes in hardware, and it can also improve the\nperformance of animating some simpler meshes. Without this option,\ncertain meshes will have to be animated in software. However, this\noption is not enabled by default, because its support seems to be buggy\nin certain drivers (ATI FireGL T2 8.103 in particular.) max-collect-indices int 65535 Specifies the maximum number of vertex indices that are allowed to\nbe accumulated into any one GeomPrimitive as a result of collecting\nobjects together during a flatten operation. This prevents the\naccidental generation of large index buffers from lots of smaller index\nbuffers, while not imposing a limit on the original size of any one\nGeomPrimitive. max-collect-vertices int 65534 Specifies the maximum number of vertices that are allowed to be\naccumulated into any one GeomVertexData structure as a result of\ncollecting objects together during a flatten operation. This prevents\nthe accidental generation of large vertex buffers from lots of smaller\nvertex buffers, while not imposing a limit on the original size of any\none GeomVertexData structure. max-color-targets int -1 Set this to a positive integer to limit the number of color targets\nreported by the GSG. This can be used to limit the amount of render\ntargets Panda will attempt to use. If this is zero or less, the GSG will\nreport its honest number of color targets, allowing Panda the full use\nof the graphics card; if it is 1 or more, then Panda will never allow\nmore than this number of color targets simultaneously, regardless of\nwhat the GSG says it can do. max-compressed-vertex-data int 0 Specifies the maximum number of bytes of all vertex data that is\nallowed to remain compressed in system RAM at one time. If more than\nthis number of bytes of vertices are created, the least-recently-used\nones will be temporarily flushed to disk until they are needed. Set it\nto -1 for no limit. max-disk-vertex-data int -1 Specifies the maximum number of bytes of vertex data that is allowed\nto be written to disk. Set it to -1 for no limit. max-dt double -1.0 Sets a limit on the value returned by ClockObject::get_dt(). If this\nvalue is less than zero, no limit is imposed; otherwise, this is the\nmaximum value that will ever be returned by get_dt(), regardless of how\nmuch time has actually elapsed between frames. See\nClockObject::set_dt(). max-heap-size int64 0 If this is nonzero, it is the maximum number of bytes expected to be\nallocated on the heap before we enter report-memory-usage mode\nautomatically. The assumption is that once this limit has been crossed,\nwe must be leaking. max-independent-vertex-data int -1 Specifies the maximum number of bytes of all vertex data that is\nindependent of the paging system. This is an initial buffer before\nmax-ram-vertex-data, specifically designed for vertex datas that are\ndynamic in nature and may change size or be created and destroyed\nfrequently. max-lag double 0.0 This represents the time in seconds by which to artificially lag\ninbound messages. It is useful to test a game's tolerance of network\nlatency. max-lenses int 100 Specifies an upper limit on the maximum number of lenses and the\nmaximum lens index number) that may be associated with a single\nLensNode. There is no technical reason for this limitation, but very\nlarge numbers are probably a mistake, so this can be used as a simple\nsanity check. Set it larger or smaller to suit your needs. max-occlusion-vertices int 3000 The maximum number of vertices that may be included in a PandaNode\nand its descendents in order to perform an occlusion query for it.\nSubgraphs whose total vertex count exceeds this number will be\nsubdivided further before performing an occlusion test--the hope is that\nwe can eventually get to a finer-grained answer. GeomNodes and Geoms\nwill not be subdivided, regardless of this limit. max-resident-vertex-data int -1 Specifies the maximum number of bytes of all vertex data that is\nallowed to remain resident in system RAM at one time. If more than this\nnumber of bytes of vertices are created, the least-recently-used ones\nwill be temporarily compressed in system RAM until they are needed. Set\nit to -1 for no limit. max-texture-dimension int -1 Set this to the maximum size a texture is allowed to be in either\ndimension. This is generally intended as a simple way to restrict\ntexture sizes for limited graphics cards. When this is greater than\nzero, each texture image loaded from a file (but only those loaded from\na file) will be automatically scaled down, if necessary, so that neither\ndimension is larger than this value. If this is less than zero, the size\nlimit is taken from the primary GSG. If this is exactly zero, there is\nno limit. max-texture-stages int -1 Set this to a positive integer to limit the number of texture stages\nreported by the GSG. This can be used to limit the amount of\nmultitexturing Panda will attempt to use. If this is zero or less, the\nGSG will report its honest number of texture stages, allowing Panda the\nfull use of the graphics card; if it is 1 or more, then Panda will never\nallow more than this number of texture stages simultaneously, regardless\nof what the GSG says it can do. merge-lod-bundles bool 1 min-lag double 0.0 This represents the time in seconds by which to artificially lag\ninbound messages. It is useful to test a game's tolerance of network\nlatency. min-occlusion-vertices int 300 The minimum number of vertices a PandaNode or Geom must contain in\norder to perform an occlusion query for it. Nodes and Geoms smaller than\nthis will be rendered directly, without bothering with an occlusion\nquery. model-cache-dir undefined $HOME/.panda3d/cache (from Config.prc); hardcoded model-cache-textures undefined #f (from Config.prc); hardcoded model-path undefined $MAIN_DIR (from Config.prc); $THIS_PRC_DIR/.. (from Config.prc);\n$THIS_PRC_DIR/../models (from Config.prc); hardcoded movies-sync-pages bool 1 Set this true to force multi-page MovieTextures to hold pages back\nif necessary until all pages are ready to render at once, so that the\nmultiple pages of a single movie are always in sync with each other. Set\nthis false to allow individual pages to be visible as soon as they come\navailable, which means pages might sometimes be out of sync. This only\naffects multi-page MovieTextures such as cube maps, 3-d textures, or\nstereo textures, or textures with separate color and alpha channel movie\nsources. multi-sleep bool 0 DConfig multifile-always-binary bool 0 This is a temporary transition variable. Set this true to enable the\nold behavior for multifiles: all subfiles are always added to and\nextracted from the multifile in binary mode. Set it false to enable the\nnew behavior: subfiles may be added or extracted in either binary or\ntext mode, according to the set_binary() or set_text() flag on the\nFilename. multisamples int 0 (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded The minimum number of samples requested. name-deleted-mutexes bool 0 Set this true to allocate a name to each Mutex object that\ndestructs, so if the Mutex is locked after destruction, we can print out\nits name to aid debugging. This is only available when compiled with\nDEBUG_THREADS. Enabling this variable will cause a memory leak, so you\nshould only enable it when you are specifically tracking down an\noperation on a deleted Mutex. It is not guaranteed to work, of course,\nbecause the memory for a deleted Mutex may become reused for some other\npurpose. net-max-read-per-epoch int 1024 The maximum number of bytes to read from the net in a single thread\nepoch, when SIMPLE_THREADS is defined. This is designed to minimize the\nimpact of the networking layer on the other threads. net-max-write-per-epoch int 1024 The maximum number of bytes to write to the net in a single thread\nepoch, when SIMPLE_THREADS is defined. This is designed to minimize the\nimpact of the networking layer on the other threads. net-thread-priority enum low The default thread priority when creating threaded readers or\nwriters. newline-mode enum native Controls how newlines are written by Panda applications writing to a\ntext file. The default, \"native\", means to write newlines appropriate to\nthe current platform. You may also specify \"binary\", to avoid molesting\nthe file data, or one of \"msdos\", \"unix\", or \"mac\". no-loading-screen bool 0 Set this to true to disable the loading screen when a transition has\nbeen invoked. no-singular-invert bool 0 Set this true to make singular-invert warning messages generate an\nassertion failure instead of just a warning (which can then be trapped\nwith assert-abort). no-unsupported-copy bool 0 Set this true to make an attempt to copy an unsupported type\ngenerate an assertion failure instead of just a warning (which can then\nbe trapped with assert-abort). notify-integrate bool 1 notify-level enum warning (from Config.prc); unspecified hardcoded Default severity of this notify category notify-level-BufferViewer string

the occlusion\nbuffer. occlusion-size int 256 256 Specify the x y size of the buffer used for occlusion testing. old-alpha-blend bool 0 Set this to true to enable the old alpha blending behavior from\nPanda 1.9 in which the alpha value written out to the framebuffer is\nsquared. The new behavior is more intuitive when compositing an\nsemitransparent image produced using render-to-texture. You should\ngenerally leave this false unless you have an effect that relies on the\nold behavior, or you suspect an implementation bug. on-screen-debug-enabled bool 0 on-screen-debug-fg-alpha double 0.85 on-screen-debug-fg-color string white on-screen-debug-bg-color string black on-screen-debug-font string cmtt12 Used to set the font for the on screen debug module. on-screen-debug-font-scale double 0.05 Used to adjust the scale of the font for the on screen debug\nmodule. openal-device string Specify the OpenAL device string for audio playback (no quotes). If\nthis is not specified, the OpenAL default device is used. opus-enable-seek bool 1 Set this to false if you're having trouble with seeking while using\nthe Opus decoder. orig-gui-sounds bool 0 package-full-dl-retries int 1 Amount of retries allowed from unexpected failures while downloading\na package from the Internet. panda-package-host-url string This can be used to specify the value returned by\nPandaSystem::get_package_host_url(), in development mode only, and only\nif another value has not already been compiled in. This is intended for\ndeveloper convenience, to masquerade a development build of Panda as a\ndifferent runtime version. Use with caution. panda-package-version string local_dev This can be used to specify the value returned by\nPandaSystem::get_package_version_str(), in development mode only, and\nonly if another value has not already been compiled in. This is intended\nfor developer convenience, to masquerade a development build of Panda as\na different runtime version. Use with caution. parallax-mapping-samples int 3 Sets the amount of samples to use in the parallax mapping\nimplementation. A value of 0 means to disable it entirely. parallax-mapping-scale double 0.1 Sets the strength of the effect of parallax mapping, that is, how\nmuch influence the height values have on the texture coordinates. paranoid-compose bool 0 Set this true to double-check the componentwise transform compose\n(or invert) operation against the equivalent matrix-based operation.\nThis has no effect if NDEBUG is defined. paranoid-const bool 0 Set this true to double-check that nothing is inappropriately\nmodifying the supposedly const structures like RenderState,\nRenderAttrib, TransformState, and RenderEffect. This has no effect if\nNDEBUG is defined. paranoid-hpr-quat bool 0 Set this true to doublecheck the quaternion-hpr compose and\ndecompose operations against the quaternion-matrix and matrix-hpr\noperations. This only has effect if NDEBUG is not defined. parent-window-handle int 0 The window handle of the parent window to attach the Panda window\nto, for the purposes of creating an embedded window. This is an HWND on\nWindows, or the NSWindow pointer or XWindow pointer converted to an\ninteger, on OSX and X11. particle-path search-path The directories to search for particle files to be loaded. patcher-buffer-size int 16384 Limits the size of the buffer used in a single call to\nPatcher::run(). Increasing this may help the Patcher perform more work\nbefore returning. patchfile-buffer-size int 4096 patchfile-increment-size int 8 patchfile-window-size int 16 patchfile-zone-size int 10000 pfm-force-littleendian bool 0 This forces a pfm file to be read as a sequence of little-endian\nfloats, even if its scale factor is given as a positive number. pfm-resize-gaussian bool 1 Specify true to implement PfmFile::resize() with a higher-quality\nGaussian filter, or false to implement it with a faster box filter. If\npfm-resize-quick is also true, this only takes effect when the pfm is\nbeing upsampled. This just controls the behavior of resize(); you can\nalways call box_filter() or gaussian_filter() explicitly. pfm-resize-quick bool 1 Specify true to implement PfmFile::resize() with a \"quick\" filter,\nbut only when the pfm is being downsampled (to a smaller size). This\njust controls the behavior of resize(); you can always call\nquick_filter() explicitly. pfm-resize-radius double 1.0 Specify the default filter radius for PfmFile::resize(). This just\ncontrols the behavior of resize(); you can always call box_filter() or\ngaussian_filter() explicitly with a specific radius. pfm-reverse-dimensions bool 0 Understands that the width and height of a pfm file are given\nbackwards, in the form height width instead of width height, on input.\nDoes not affect output, which is always written width height. pfm-vis-max-indices int 1048576 Specifies the maximum number of vertex references that may appear in\na single generated mesh. If the mesh would require more than that, the\nmesh is subdivided into smaller pieces. pfm-vis-max-vertices int 65535 Specifies the maximum number of vertex entries that may appear in a\nsingle generated mesh. If the mesh would require more than that, the\nmesh is subdivided into smaller pieces. physics_manager_random_seed int 139 pipeline-stages int 1 The initial number of stages in the render pipeline. This is only\nmeaningful if threaded pipelining is compiled into Panda. In most cases,\nyou should not set this at all anyway, since the pipeline can\nautomatically grow stages as needed, but it will not remove stages\nautomatically, and having more pipeline stages than your application\nrequires will incur additional runtime overhead. pixel-zoom double 1.0 The default pixel_zoom factor for new windows. playback-session string DConfig plugin-path search-path The directories to search for plugin shared libraries. png-compression-level int 6 Set this to the desired compression level for writing PNG images.\nValid values are 0 (no compression), or 1 (compression, best speed) to 9\n(best compression). Default is 6. PNG compression is lossless. png-palette bool 1 Set this true to allow writing palette-based PNG images when\npossible. polylight-info bool 0 Set this true to view some info statements regarding the polylight.\nIt is helpful for debugging. pdef-path list A search list for previously-built local packages. prefer-parasite-buffer bool 0 Set this true to make GraphicsOutput::make_texture_buffer() try to\ncreate a ParasiteBuffer before it tries to create an offscreen buffer\n(assuming it could not create a direct render buffer for some reason).\nThis may reduce your graphics card memory requirements by sharing memory\nwith the framebuffer, but it can cause problems if the user subsequently\nresizes the window smaller than the buffer. prefer-single-buffer bool 1 Set this true to make GraphicsOutput::make_render_texture() first\ntry to create a single-buffered offscreen buffer, before falling back to\na double-buffered one (or whatever kind the source window has). This is\ntrue by default to reduce waste of framebuffer memory, but you might get\na performance benefit by setting it to false (since in that case the\nbuffer can share a graphics context with the window). prefer-texture-buffer bool 1 Set this true to make GraphicsOutput::make_texture_buffer() always\ntry to create an offscreen buffer supporting render-to-texture, if the\ngraphics card claims to be able to support this feature. If the graphics\ncard cannot support this feature, this option is ignored. This is\nusually the fastest way to render to a texture, and it presumably does\nnot consume any additional framebuffer memory over a copy-to-texture\noperation (since the texture and the buffer share the same memory). preload-simple-textures bool 0 When this is true, every texture image will have a simple image\ngenerated for it at load time. (Normally, textures get a simple image at\negg2bam time.) This slows the initial loading time of textures, but\nallows you to take advantage of gsg::set_incomplete_render() to load\ntextures on-the-fly in a sub-thread. It's not generally necessary if you\nare loading bam files that were generated via egg2bam. preload-textures bool 1 When this is true, texture images are loaded from disk as soon as\nthe Texture is created from the TexturePool. When this is false, the\nTexture is created immediately, but the image data is not loaded from\ndisk until the Texture is actually rendered (or otherwise prepared) on\nthe GSG. This can help reduce wasted memory from Textures that are\ncreated but never used to render. premunge-data bool 1 Set this true to preconvert vertex data at model load time to match\nthe data requirements of the current GSG. For instance, color columns\nare pre-converted to match OpenGL or DirectX encoding requirements, as\nappropriate. When this is false, the data will be munged at render time\ninstead. preserve-geom-nodes bool 0 This specifies the default value for the \"preserved\" flag on every\nGeomNode created. When this is true, GeomNodes will not be flattened, so\nsetting this true effectively disables the use of flatten to combine\nGeomNodes. preserve-triangle-strips bool 0 Set this true to indicate a preference for keeping triangle strips\nwhen possible, instead of decomposing them into triangles. When this is\ntrue, flatten_strong and unify operations may be less effective at\ncombining multiple Geoms together, but they will not implicitly\ndecompose triangle strips. print-pipe-types bool 1 profile-bias string 0 DConfig profile-frames bool 0 profile-task-spikes bool 0 project-invert-uvs bool 0 If this is true, the UV's generated by all ProjectionScreens are\ninverted top-to-bottom. This used to be required to compensate for buggy\ngraphics drivers that rendered to a texture upside-down in this manner,\nbut nowadays Panda should be able to autodetect these graphics drivers.\nIf it fails to do this, you should probably set copy-texture-inverted\ninstead, which is more general. pstats-average-time double 3.0 pstats-eventmanager bool 0 pstats-gpu-timing bool 0 Set this true to query the graphics library for the actual time that\ngraphics operations take to execute on the video card. Enabling this\nwill harm performance, but this information can be more useful than the\nregular Draw information in tracking down bottlenecks, because the\nCPU-based Draw collectors only measure how long it takes for the API\ncall to complete, which is not usually an accurate reflectino of how\nlong the actual operation takes on the video card. pstats-history double 60.0 pstats-host string localhost pstats-max-queue-size int 1 If pstats-threaded-write is true, this specifies the maximum number\nof packets (generally, frames of data) that may be queued up for the\nthread to process. If this is large, the writer thread may fall behind\nand the output of PStats will lag. Keep this small to drop missed\npackets on the floor instead, and ensure that the frame data does not\ngrow stale. pstats-max-rate double 1000.0 The maximum number of packets per second, per thread, to send to the\nremote PStats server. A packet is defined as a single UDP packet, or\neach 1024 bytes of a TCP message. pstats-mem-other bool 1 Set this true to collect memory categories smaller than 0.1% of the\ntotal into a single \"Other\" category, or false to show each nonzero\nmemory category. pstats-name string Panda Stats pstats-port int 5185 pstats-scroll-mode bool 1 pstats-target-frame-rate double 30.0 Specify the target frame rate to highlight on the PStats graph. This\nframe rate is marked with a different-colored line; otherwise, this\nsetting has no effect. pstats-tasks bool 0 pstats-tcp-ratio double 0.01 This specifies the ratio of frame update messages that are eligible\nfor UDP that are sent via TCP instead. It does not count messages that\nare too large for UDP and must be sent via TCP anyway. 1.0 means all\nmessages are sent TCP; 0.0 means all are sent UDP. pstats-threaded-write bool 1 Set this true to write to the PStats channel in a sub-thread, if\nthreading is available. Can't think of any reason why you wouldn't want\nthis set true, unless you suspect something is broken with the threaded\nnetwork interfaces. pstats-unused-states bool 0 Set this true to show the number of unused states in the pstats\ngraph for TransformState and RenderState counts. This adds a bit of\nper-frame overhead to count these things up. ptloader-load-node bool 1 Specify true to allow libptloader to invoke the more efficient but\npossibly-experimental code to load model files directly into PandaNode\nwhen possible. Specify false to force the loading to always go through\nthe egg library, which is more likely to be reliable. ptloader-units enum invalid Specifies the preferred units into which models will be converted\nwhen using libptloader to automatically convert files to Panda at load\ntime, via e.g. \"pview myMayaFile.mb\". pushers-horizontal bool 0 Set this true to make all CollisionHandlerPushers have the\nset_horizontal() flag by default, false to let the move in three\ndimensions by default. read-compressed-channels bool 1 Set this false to disable reading of compressed animation channels,\neven if the decompression code is available. The only reason you might\nwant to do this would be to speed load time when you don't care about\nwhat the animation looks like. read-raw-mice bool 0 DConfig record-session string DConfig red-blue-stereo bool 0 Set this true to create windows with red-blue stereo mode enabled by\ndefault, if the framebuffer does not support true stereo rendering. red-blue-stereo-colors string red cyan This defines the color channels that are used for the left and right\neye, respectively, for red-blue-stereo mode. This should be a two-word\nstring, where each word is one of 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'cyan',\n'magenta', 'yellow', or 'alpha', or a union of two or more words\nseparated by a vertical pipe (|). released-ibuffer-cache-size int 102400 Specifies the size in bytes of the cache of index buffers that have\nrecently been released. If a new index buffer is prepared while a\nrecently-released one of the same size is still in the cache, that same\nbuffer is recycled. This cuts down on the overhead of creating and\ndestroying index buffers on the graphics card. released-vbuffer-cache-size int 1048576 Specifies the size in bytes of the cache of vertex buffers that have\nrecently been released. If a new vertex buffer is prepared while a\nrecently-released one of the same size is still in the cache, that same\nbuffer is recycled. This cuts down on the overhead of creating and\ndestroying vertex buffers on the graphics card. remove-callback-window bool 0 When set to false, removes the callback window as stated in\nWxPandaWindow. report-frame-rate-interval double 300.0 How many milliseconds delay for each frame rate report. report-memory-interval double 5.0 This is the interval, in seconds, for reports of currently allocated\nmemory, when report-memory-usage is true. report-memory-usage bool 0 Set this true to enable automatic reporting of allocated objects at\nthe interval specified by report-memory-interval. This also requires\ntrack-memory-usage. require-window bool 1 DConfig rescale-normals enum auto Specifies the kind of RescaleNormalAttrib that should be created for\nthe top of the scene graph. This can automatically ensure that your\nlighting normals are unit-length, which may be particularly necessary in\nthe presence of scales in the scene graph. Turning it off ('none') may\nproduce a small performance benefit. respect-effective-normal bool 1 This should be true to support the effective_normal interface of\npolygons. Set it false to disable this feature, so that all collision\nsolids (including polygons and planes) use their actual normal for\nintersection and physics tests. respect-prev-transform bool 0 Set this true to have all CollisionTraversers in the world respect\nthe previous frame's transform (position) for a given object when\ndetermining motion for collision tests. If this is false, you must\nexplicitly enable motion detection for a particular traverser. It is\nfalse by default to force programmers to decide on a case-by-case basis\nwhether they really need this feature. restore-initial-pose bool 1 When this is true, setting all control effects on an Actor to 0\ncauses it to return to its default, unanimated pose. When false, it\nretains whatever its last-computed pose was (which may or may not be the\ndefault pose). retransform-sprites bool 1 To render sprite-based particle effects, Panda must convert the\nsprite points from object space into clip space, and compute the corners\nof the quads in clip space. When this variable is false, the resulting\nquads are then sent to the graphics hardware in clip space. When this is\ntrue, the quads are re-transformed back into the original object space,\nwhich is necessary in order for fog to work correctly on the\nsprites. sampler-object-limit int 2048 This is a default limit that is imposed on each GSG at GSG creation\ntime. It limits the total amount of sampler objects that will be k.ept\nby the GSG, regardless of whether the hardware claims to provide more\nsampler objects than this. Direct3D 10-capable hardware supports at\nleast 4096 distinct sampler objects, but we provide a slightly more\nconservative limit by default. sbs-left-dimensions double 0.0 0.5 0.0 1.0 Defines the default region of the window that is used for the left\neye, when side-by-side stereo is enabled. This is a set of four numbers,\nin the form left right top bottom, similar to a normal DisplayRegion\nlayout. sbs-right-dimensions double 0.5 1.0 0.0 1.0 Defines the default region of the window that is used for the right\neye, when side-by-side stereo is enabled. This is a set of four numbers,\nin the form left right top bottom, similar to a normal DisplayRegion\nlayout. scene-graph-analyzer-meter-layer-sort int 1000 scene-graph-analyzer-meter-scale double 0.05 scene-graph-analyzer-meter-side-margins double 0.5 scene-graph-analyzer-meter-update-interval double 2.0 screenshot-extension string jpg DConfig screenshot-filename string %~p-%a-%b-%d-%H-%M-%S-%Y-%~f.%~e This specifies the filename pattern to be used to generate\nscreenshots captured via save_screenshot_default(). See\nDisplayRegion::save_screenshot(). scroll-continued-delay double 0.1 This is the amount of time, in seconds, to delay between lines\nscrolled while the user is continuing to hold down the scrollbar\nbutton. scroll-initial-delay double 0.3 This is the amount of time, in seconds, to delay after the user\nfirst clicks and holds on a scrollbar button before the scrolling\ncontinues automatically. sgi-imagename string This string is written to the header of an SGI (*.rgb) file. It\nseems to have documentation purposes only. sgi-storage-type enum rle Use either 'rle' or 'verbatim' to indicate how SGI (*.rgb) files are\nwritten. shadow-depth-bits int 24 The minimum number of depth buffer bits requested when rendering\nshadow maps. Set this to 32 for more depth resolution in shadow\nmaps. show-buffers bool 0 show-dll-error-dialog bool 0 Set this true to enable the Windows system dialog that pops up when\na DLL fails to load, or false to disable it. show-frame-rate-meter bool #f (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded DConfig show-occluder-volumes bool 0 Set this true to enable debug visualization of the volumes used to\ncull objects behind an occluder. show-occlusion bool 0 Set this true to visualize the efforts of the occlusion test. show-rope bool 1 When true, displays a animated \"rope\". Represents a NURBS curve\nwhose control verticies are defined base on points relative to one or\nmore nodes in space. show-scene-graph-analyzer-meter bool 0 DConfig show-tex-mem bool 0 DConfig show-transparency bool 0 Set this true to flash any objects that are rendered in some\ntransparency mode. The color chosen is based on the particular\ntransparency mode in effect. This only has effect when NDEBUG is not\ndefined. show-vertex-animation bool 0 Set this true to flash any objects whose vertices are animated by\nPanda on the CPU (flash red) or by hardware (flash blue). This only has\neffect when NDEBUG is not defined. side-by-side-stereo bool 0 Set this true to create windows with side-by-side stereo mode\nenabled by default, if the framebuffer does not support true stereo\nrendering. simple-image-size int 16 16 This is an x y pair that specifies the maximum size of an\nautomatically-generated texture simple image. The simple image can\ndisplayed before the texture has been loaded from disk. simple-image-threshold double 0.1 This is a value that indicates how closely a texture's generated\nsimple image should approximate the original image. The smaller the\nnumber, the closer the match; small numbers will result in simple images\nclose to the maximum size specified by simple-image-size. Larger numbers\nwill result in smaller simple images. Generally the value should be\nconsiderably less than 1. singular-points bool 1 Set this true to insist that when RenderModeAttrib::M_points is\nused, each point appears only once in the result, even if the vertex is\nreferenced multiple times. This is particularly important when rendering\npoints from a triangle mesh and you don't want the points to appear\nrepeatedly. sleep-precision double 0.01 This is the accuracy within which we can expect select() to return\nprecisely. That is, if we use select() to request a timeout of 1.0\nseconds, we can expect to actually sleep for somewhere between 1.0 and\n1.0 + sleep-precision seconds. ssl-certificates list This variable lists additional filenames, on top of the file named\nby ca-bundle-filename, that contain trusted SSL certificates or\ncertificate authorities. state-cache bool 1 Set this true to enable the cache of RenderState objects, similar to\nthe TransformState cache controlled via transform-cache. stencil-bits int 0 (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded The minimum number of stencil buffer bits requested. stereo-lens-old-convergence bool 0 In Panda3D 1.8 and below, when using a stereo lens, Panda generate\nan incorrect frustum skew for a given convergence distance, meaning that\nthe left-right images wouldn't overlap at the configured distance. This\ncalculation has since been corrected, but if your application relies on\nthe old, incorrect behavior, this may be set to 'true' to switch back to\nthe old calculation. stm-heightfield-magfilter enum linear This specifies the magfilter that is applied for a heightfield\ntexture. This can be used to create heightfield that is visual correct\nwith collision geometry (for example bullet terrain mesh) by changing it\nto nearest. stm-heightfield-minfilter enum linear This specifies the minfilter that is applied for a heightfield\ntexture. This can be used to create heightfield that is visual correct\nwith collision geometry (for example bullet terrain mesh) by changing it\nto nearest. stm-max-chunk-count int 2048 Controls the maximum amount of chunks the Terrain can display. If\nyou use a high LOD, you might have to increment this value. The lower\nthis value is the less data has to be transferred to the GPU. stm-max-views int 8 Controls the maximum amount of different views the Terrain can be\nrendered with. Each camera rendering the terrain corresponds to a view.\nLowering this value will reduce the data that has to be transferred to\nthe GPU. stm-use-hexagonal-layout bool 0 Set this to true to use a hexagonal vertex layout. This approximates\nthe heightfield in a better way, however the CLOD transitions might be\nvisible due to the vertices not matching exactly. subprocess-window filename The filename of a SubprocessWindowBuffer's temporary mmap file, used\nfor opening a window in a child process and rendering to a different\nwindow in the parent process. This is specifically used for OSX when the\nplugin is compiled, and is not used or needed in other environments. See\nWindowProperties::set_subprocess_window(). subprocess-window-max-wait double 0.2 This is the amount of time, in seconds, that the SubprocessWindow\nwill wait in begin_flip for the parent process to remove the\npreviously-rendered frame. When this time is exceeded, the next frame\nwill be rendered without having flipped the previous one. This is\ndesigned to allow the Python process some time to run even when the\nparent window is offscreen or minimized. support-fade-lod bool 1 Set this false to make FadeLOD nodes behave like regular LOD nodes\n(ignoring the fade time). This may be useful, for instance, to test the\nperformance impact of using FadeLOD nodes. support-ipv6 bool 1 Specifies whether IPv6 support should be enabled. This should be\ntrue unless you are experiencing issues with Panda's IPv6 support or are\nusing a misconfigured system. support-render-texture bool 1 Set this true allow use of the render-to-a-texture feature, if it is\nsupported by your graphics card. Without this enabled, offscreen renders\nwill be copied to a texture instead of directly rendered there. support-rescale-normal bool 1 Set this true to allow use of the rescale-normal feature, if it is\nsupported by your graphics card. This allows lighting normals to be\nuniformly counter-scaled, instead of re-normalized, in the presence of a\nuniform scale, which should in principle be a bit faster. This feature\nis only supported by the OpenGL API. support-stencil bool 1 Set this true to allow use of the stencil buffer, if it is supported\nby your graphics card. If this is false, stencil buffer support will not\nbe enabled, even if it is supported. Generally, only very old cards do\nnot support some kind of stencil buffer operations; but it is also not\nsupported by our tinydisplay renderer. The main reason to set this false\nis to test your code in the absence of stencil buffer support. support-threads bool 1 Set this false to disallow the creation of threads using Panda's\nThread interface, even if threading support is compiled in. This does\nnot affect the operation of mutexes and other synchronization\nprimitives, just the creation of threads. swap-eyes bool 0 Set this true to reverse the left and right channel output of stereo\nDisplayRegions. sync-flip bool 0 Set this true to attempt to flip all windows at the same time, or\nfalse to flip each window as late as possible. Setting this false can\nimprove parallelization. This is a temporary variable; it will later be\nreplaced with a more explicit control over synchronizing window\nflip. sync-video bool 1 Configure this true to request the rendering to sync to the video\nrefresh, or false to let your frame rate go as high as it can,\nirrespective of the video refresh. Usually you want this true, but it\nmay be useful to set it false during development for a cheesy estimate\nof scene complexity. Some drivers may ignore this request. task-timer-verbose bool 0 tcp-header-size int 2 Specifies the number of bytes to use to specify the datagram length\nwhen writing a datagram on a TCP stream. This may be 0, 2, or 4. The\nserver and client must agree on this value. tex-mem-win-size int 300 300 Specifies the window resolution for the Texture Memory viewer. tex-mem-win-origin int 100 100 Specifies the window popup location for the Texture Memory\nviewer. text-anisotropic-degree int 1 This is the default anisotropic-degree that is set on dynamic font\ntextures. Setting this to a value greater than 1 can help smooth out the\nantialiasing for small letters. text-default-font filename This names a filename that will be loaded at startup time as the\ndefault font for any TextNode that does not specify a font otherwise.\nThe default is to use a special font that is compiled into Panda, if\navailable. text-default-underscore-height double -0.2 Specifies the default height of the underscore line, relative to the\ntext baseline, when underscoring is enabled. text-dynamic-merge bool 1 Set this true to merge generated glyphs into the GeomVertexData as\nthe text is assembled, or false to wait for the flatten operation.\nUsually it's a performance advantage to keep this true. See\nTextNode::set_flatten_flags(). text-embed-graphic-key int 5 This is the decimal character number that, embedded in a string, is\nused to bracket the name of a model added to the TextPropertiesManager\nobject, to embed an arbitrary graphic image within a paragraph. text-encoding enum utf8 Specifies how international characters are represented in strings of\n8-byte characters presented to Panda. See\nTextEncoder::set_encoding(). text-flatten bool 1 Set this true to flatten text when it is generated, or false to keep\nit as a deep hierarchy. Usually it's a performance advantage to keep\nthis true, but this also depends on the setting of text-dynamic-merge.\nSee TextNode::set_flatten_flags(). text-hyphen-ratio double 0.7 If the rightmost whitespace character falls before this fraction of\nthe line, hyphenate a word to the right of that if possible. text-kerning bool 0 Set this true to enable kerning when the font provides kerning\ntables. This can result in more aesthetically pleasing spacing between\nindividual glyphs. Has no effect when text-use-harfbuzz is true, since\nHarfBuzz offers superior kerning support. text-magfilter enum linear The default texture magfilter type for dynamic text fonts text-max-never-break int 3 If we have more than this number of text-never-break-before\ncharacters in a row, do not treat any of them as special and instead\nbreak the line wherever we can. text-minfilter enum linear The default texture minfilter type for dynamic text fonts text-native-antialias bool 1 text-page-size int 256 256 This is the default size for new textures created for dynamic\nfonts. text-pixels-per-unit double 40.0 text-point-size double 10.0 text-poly-margin double 0.0 This is the amount by which to make each glyph polygon larger than\nstrictly necessary, in screen units that are added to each margin.\nIncreasing this value will decrease the tendency for letters to get\nchopped off at the edges, but it will also increase the tendency for\nadjacent glyphs to bleed into each other (unless you also increase\ntext-texture-margin). text-pop-properties-key int 2 This is the decimal character number that undoes the effect of a\nprevious appearance of text_push_properties_key. text-push-properties-key int 1 This is the decimal character number that, embedded in a string, is\nused to bracket the name of a TextProperties structure added to the\nTextPropertiesManager object, to control the appearance of subsequent\ntext. text-quality-level enum best The default quality level for dynamic text fonts; see\nTexture::set_quality_level(). text-render-mode enum texture The default render mode for dynamic text fonts text-scale-factor double 2.0 text-small-caps bool 0 This controls the default setting for\nTextNode::set_small_caps(). text-small-caps-scale double 0.800000011920929 This controls the default setting for\nTextNode::set_small_caps_scale(). text-soft-break-key int 4 This is similar to text-soft-hyphen-key, except that when it is used\nas a break point, no character is introduced in its place. text-soft-hyphen-key int 3 This is the decimal character number that, embedded in a string, is\nidentified as the soft-hyphen character. text-tab-width double 5.0 This controls the default setting for\nTextNode::set_tab_width(). text-texture-margin int 2 This is the number of texels of empty space reserved around each\nglyph in the texture. Setting this value larger will decrease the\ntendency for adjacent glyphs to bleed into each other at small sizes,\nbut it will increase amount of wasted texture memory. text-use-harfbuzz bool 0 Set this true to enable HarfBuzz support, which offers superior text\nshaping and better support for non-Latin text. text-wrap-mode enum border_color The default wrap mode for dynamic text fonts texture-anisotropic-degree int 1 This specifies the default anisotropic degree that is applied to a\ntexture in the absence of a particular anisotropic degree setting (that\nis, a texture for which the anisotropic degree is 0, meaning the default\nsetting). It should be 1 to disable anisotropic filtering, or a higher\nnumber to enable it. Note if this variable is changed at runtime, you\nmay need to reload textures explicitly in order to change their visible\nproperties. texture-filter list Names one or more external libraries that should be loaded for the\npurposes of performing texture filtering. This variable may be repeated\nseveral times. As in load-display, the actual library filename is\nderived by prefixing 'lib' to the specified name. texture-magfilter enum linear This specifies the default magfilter that is applied to a texture in\nthe absence of a specific magfilter setting. Normally this is 'linear'\n(since mipmapping does not apply to magfilters). This does not apply to\ndepth textures. Note if this variable is changed at runtime, you may\nneed to reload textures explicitly in order to change their visible\nproperties. texture-minfilter enum linear This specifies the default minfilter that is applied to a texture in\nthe absence of a specific minfilter setting. Normally this is either\n'linear' to disable mipmapping by default, or 'mipmap', to enable\ntrilinear mipmapping by default. This does not apply to depth textures.\nNote if this variable is changed at runtime, you may need to reload\ntextures explicitly in order to change their visible properties. texture-quality-level enum normal This specifies a global quality level for all textures. You may\nspecify either fastest, normal, or best. This actually affects the\nmeaning of Texture::set_quality_level(QL_default), so it may be\noverridden on a per-texture basis. This generally only has an effect\nwhen using the tinydisplay software renderer; it has little or no effect\non normal, hardware-accelerated renderers. See\nTexture::set_quality_level(). texture-scale double 1.0 This is a global scale factor that is applied to each texture as it\nis loaded from disk. For instance, a value of 0.5 will reduce each\ntexture to one-half its size in each dimension. This scale factor is\napplied before textures-power-2 or max-texture-dimension. texture-scale-limit int 4 This specifies the limit below which texture-scale will not reduce a\ntexture image. This is a single dimension which applies to both X and\nY. textures-auto-power-2 bool 0 If this is true, then panda will wait until you open a window, and\nthen ask the window if it supports non-power-of-two textures. If so,\nthen the config variable textures_power_2 will automatically be\nadjusted. The pitfall of doing this is that if you then open a second\nwindow that doesn't support the same capabilities, it will have no\nchoice but to print an error message. textures-header-only bool 0 If this is true, texture images will not actually be loaded from\ndisk, but the image header information will be consulted to verify\nnumber of channels and so forth. The texture images themselves will be\ngenerated in a default blue color. textures-power-2 enum down Specify whether textures should automatically be constrained to\ndimensions which are a power of 2 when they are loaded from disk. Set\nthis to 'none' to disable this feature, or to 'down' or 'up' to scale\ndown or up to the nearest power of 2, respectively. This only has effect\non textures which are not already a power of 2. textures-square enum none Specify whether textures should automatically be constrained to a\nsquare aspect ratio when they are loaded from disk. Set this to 'none',\n'down', or 'up'. See textures-power-2. tga-colormap bool 0 Set this true to write colormapped TGA files. tga-grayscale bool 0 Set this true to enable writing grayscale TGA files. tga-rle bool 0 Set this true to enable RLE compression when writing TGA files. thread-stack-size int 4194304 Specifies the minimum size, in bytes, of the stack that will be\ncreated for each newly-created thread. Not all thread implementations\nrespect this value. threading-model string This is the default threading model to use for new windows. Use\nempty string for single-threaded, or something like \"cull/draw\" for a\n3-stage pipeline. See GraphicsEngine::set_threading_model().\nEXPERIMENTAL and incomplete, do not use this! time-manager-extra-skew int 0 A simulated clock skew for debugging, in seconds. time-manager-freq double 1800 The number of seconds to wait between automatic synchronizations.\nSet to 0 to disable auto sync after startup. time-manager-min-wait double 10 The minimum number of seconds to wait between two unrelated\nsynchronization attempts. Increasing this number cuts down on frivolus\nsynchronization. time-manager-max-uncertainty double 1 The maximum number of seconds of uncertainty to tolerate in the\nclock delta without trying again. tk-frame-rate double 60.0 Set a timer to run the Panda frame 60 times a second. tk-main-loop bool true Put Tkinter in charge of the main loop. Otherwise, the GUI becomes\nlargely unresponsive on Mac OS X unless this is true. track-gui-items bool 1 DConfig track-memory-usage bool 0 Set this to true to enable full-force tracking of C++ allocations\nand recordkeeping by type. It's quite expensive. trackball-use-alt-keys bool 1 Set this true to use the command and option/control keys in\nconjunction with the first mouse button to simulate the behavior of the\nsecond and third mouse buttons in trackball mode. Particularly useful\nfor Macs, or laptops with limited mouse buttons. transform-cache bool 1 Set this true to enable the cache of TransformState objects. Using\nthe cache saves time computing transforms and inverse transforms, but\nimposes some overhead for maintaining the cache itself. unambiguous-graph bool 0 Set this true to make ambiguous path warning messages generate an\nassertion failure instead of just a warning (which can then be trapped\nwith assert-abort). undecorated bool 0 This specifies the default value of the 'undecorated' window\nproperty. When this is true, the default window is created without a\ntitle bar or resizable border. uniquify-attribs bool 1 Set this true to ensure that equivalent RenderAttribs are\npointerwise equal. This may improve caching performance, but also adds\nadditional overhead to maintain the cache, including the need to check\nfor a composition cycle in the cache. uniquify-matrix bool 1 Set this true to look up arbitrary 4x4 transform matrices in the\ncache, to ensure that two differently-computed transforms that happen to\nencode the same matrix will be collapsed into a single pointer.\nNowadays, with the transforms stored in a hashtable, we're generally\nbetter off with this set true. uniquify-states bool 1 Set this true to ensure that equivalent RenderStates are pointerwise\nequal. This may improve caching performance, but also adds additional\noverhead to maintain the cache, including the need to check for a\ncomposition cycle in the cache. uniquify-transforms bool 1 Set this true to ensure that equivalent TransformStates are\npointerwise equal. This may improve caching performance, but also adds\nadditional overhead to maintain the cache, including the need to check\nfor a composition cycle in the cache. upload-stack-dump bool 0 DConfig use-movietexture undefined #t (from Config.prc); hardcoded validate-subparts bool 1 variable-dump-on-exception-init bool 0 Unstable; intended to dump variables when an exception is\ninvoked. verify-dcast bool 1 Set this to true to verify that every attempted DCAST operation in\nfact references the correct type, or false otherwise. This has no effect\nif NDEBUG is defined, in which case it is never tested. verify-intervals bool 0 Set this true to generate an assertion failure if interval functions\nare called out-of-order. verify-lods bool 0 When this is true, LODNodes will test when they are rendered to\nensure that each child's geometry fits entirely within the radius\ndefined by its switch-out distance. When it is false, LODNodes may have\nany switch in and out distances, regardless of the actual size of their\ngeometry. This test is only made in NDEBUG mode (the variable is ignored\nin a production build). vertex-animation-align-16 bool 1 If this is true, then animated vertices will be created with\n4-component floats and aligned to 16-byte boundaries, to allow efficient\nvectorization (e.g. SSE2) operations when computing animations. If this\nis false, animated vertices will be packed as tightly as possible, in\nthe normal way, which will optimize the amount of memory that must be\nsent to the graphics card, but prevent the use of SSE2 to calculate\nanimation. This does not affect unanimated vertices, which are always\npacked tightly. This also impacts only vertex formats created within\nPanda subsystems; custom vertex formats are not affected. vertex-arrays bool 1 Set this true to allow the use of vertex arrays for rendering OpenGL\nvertex data. This, or vertex buffers, is the normal way of issuing\nvertices ever since OpenGL 1.1, and you almost always want to have this\nset to true. However, some very buggy graphics drivers may have problems\nhandling vertex arrays correctly, so if you are experiencing problems\nyou might try setting this to false. If this is false, Panda will fall\nback to using immediate-mode commands like glVertex3f(), etc., to issue\nthe vertices, which is potentially much slower than vertex arrays.\nSetting this false also disables vertex buffers, effectively ignoring\nthe setting of the vertex-buffers variable (since vertex buffers are a\nspecial case of vertex arrays in OpenGL). This variable is normally not\nenabled in a production build. This has no effect on DirectX\nrendering. vertex-buffers bool 1 Set this true to allow the use of vertex buffers (or buffer objects,\nas OpenGL dubs them) for rendering vertex data. This can greatly improve\nrendering performance on higher-end graphics cards, at the cost of some\nadditional graphics memory (which might otherwise be used for textures\nor offscreen buffers). On lower-end graphics cards this will make little\nor no difference. vertex-column-alignment int 4 This specifies the default byte alignment for each column of data\nwithin a GeomVertexData when it is assembled using the default\ninterfaces. Normally, you should not change this config variable (which\nwould change this value globally), but instead specify any alignment\nrequirements on a per-column basis as you construct a GeomVertexFormat.\nSetting this value globally could result in much needless wasted space\nin all vertex data objects, but it could be useful for simple\nexperiments. Also see vertex-animation-align-16 for a variable that\ncontrols this alignment for the vertex animation columns only. vertex-data-compression-level int 1 Specifies the zlib compression level to use when compressing vertex\ndata. The number should be in the range 1 to 9, where larger values are\nslower but give better compression. vertex-data-page-size int 262144 The number of bytes to allocate at a time for vertex data. This also\ncontrols the page size that is compressed or written to disk when vertex\ndata pages are evicted from memory. vertex-data-page-threads int 1 When this is nonzero (and Panda has been compiled with thread\nsupport) then this number of sub-threads will be spawned to evict vertex\npages to disk and read them back again. When this is 0, this work will\nbe done in the main thread, which may introduce occasional random chugs\nin rendering. vertex-data-small-size int 64 When a GeomVertexArrayData is this number of bytes or smaller, it is\ndeemed too small to pay the overhead of paging it in and out, and it is\npermanently retained resident. vertex-save-file-directory filename The directory in which the saved vertex data file is created for\nsaving vertex buffers that have been evicted from RAM. If this is the\nempty string, or an invalid directory, a system default directory will\nbe chosen. vertex-save-file-prefix string p3d_vdata_ A prefix used to generate the filename for the saved vertex data\nfile which is created for saving vertex buffers that have been evicted\nfrom RAM. A uniquifying sequence number and filename extension will be\nappended to this string. vertices-float64 bool 0 When this is true, the default float format for vertices will be a\n64-bit double-precision float, instead of the normal 32-bit\nsingle-precision float. This must be set at static init time to have the\nbroadest effect. You almost never want to set this true, since current\nhardware does not support double-precision vertices, and setting this\nwill just require the driver to downsample the vertices at load time,\nmaking everything slower. vfs-case-sensitive bool 1 Set this true to make the VirtualFileSystem present the native\nOS-provided filesystem as if it were a case-sensitive file system, even\nif it is not (e.g. on Windows). This variable has no effect if the\nnative filesystem is already case-sensitive, and it has no effect on\nmounted multifile systems, which are always case-sensitive. vfs-implicit-mf bool 0 When this is true, the VirtualFileSystem will automatically mount\nmultifiles on-the-fly when they are used as directories. For instance,\nopening the file /c/files/foo.mf/dirname/mytex.jpg will implicitly\nretrieve a file named 'dirname/mytex.jpg' within the multifile\n/c/files/foo.mf, even if the multifile has not already been mounted.\nThis makes all of your multifiles act like directories. vfs-implicit-pz bool 1 When this is true, the VirtualFileSystem will pretend a named file\nexists even if it doesn't, as long as a filename with the same name and\nthe additional extension .pz does exist. In this case, the\nVirtualFileSystem will implicitly open the .pz file and decompress it\non-the-fly. vfs-mount list vfs-mount system-filename mount-point [options] vfs-mount-ramdisk string vfs-mount-ramdisk mount-point [options] vfs-mount-url list vfs-mount-url http://example.com/path\\ [:port]\nmount-point [options] view-frustum-cull bool 1 This is normally true; set it false to disable view-frustum culling\n(primarily useful for debugging). vorbis-enable-seek bool 1 Set this to false if you're having trouble with seeking while using\nthe Ogg Vorbis decoder. vorbis-seek-lap bool 1 If this is set to true, the Ogg Vorbis decoder will automatically\ncrosslap the transition from the previous playback position into the new\nplayback position when seeking in order to eliminate clicking and\nboundary discontinuities. vrpn-analog-deadband double 0.125 vrpn-analog-max double 0.95 vrpn-analog-min double -0.95 vrpn-server string spacedyne Set a vrpn server name for the client to connect. want-avatar-physics-indicator bool 0 Set this to true to enable a debug window that displays an avatars\nposition, its heading/yaw value, and the current playing animation. want-dev bool 1 DConfig want-directtools bool #f (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded DConfig want-env-debug-info bool 0 DConfig want-floor-sphere bool 0 If this is set to true, a collision sphere will be generated and\nparented to objects set with FloorBitmask want-fog bool 1 DConfig want-pstats bool #f (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded DConfig want-render2dp bool 1 DConfig want-tk bool #f (from Config.prc); 0 hardcoded DConfig want-uberdog bool 1 DConfig want-verify-pdb bool 0 When set to true, loads pdb on failure to verify. want-WASD bool 0 Used in the Actor class to enable WASD movement controls. want-wx bool 0 DConfig win-fixed-size bool 0 This specifies the default value of the 'fixed_size' window\nproperty. When this is true, the default window is created without a\nresizable border. win-origin int -2 -2 (from Config.prc); hardcoded This is the default position at which to open a new window. This\nreplaces the deprecated win-origin-x and win-origin-y variables. A\nwindow coordinate of -1 means to choose a default value, whereas -2\nmeans to center the window on the screen. win-size int 800 600 (from Config.prc); 800 600 hardcoded This is the default size at which to open a new window. This\nreplaces the deprecated win-width and win-height variables. win-unexposed-draw bool 1 Specifies the default setting of\nGraphicsWindow::set_unexposed_draw(). See that method for more\ninformation. window-inverted bool 0 Set this true to create all windows with the inverted flag set, so\nthat they will render upside-down and backwards. Normally this is useful\nonly for debugging. window-title string Panda window-type string onscreen DConfig wx-frame-rate double 60.0 Set a timer to run the Panda frame 60 times per second. wx-main-loop bool 1 Put wxPython in charge of the main loop; some features of wx don't\nwork properly unless this is true. x-error-abort bool 0 Set this true to trigger and abort (and a stack trace) on receipt of\nan error from the X window system. This can make it easier to discover\nwhere these errors are generated. x-wheel-down-button int 5 This is the mouse button index of the wheel_down event: which mouse\nbutton number does the system report when the mouse wheel is rolled one\nnotch down? x-wheel-left-button int 6 This is the mouse button index of the wheel_left event: which mouse\nbutton number does the system report when one scrolls to the left? x-wheel-right-button int 7 This is the mouse button index of the wheel_right event: which mouse\nbutton number does the system report when one scrolls to the right? x-wheel-up-button int 4 This is the mouse button index of the wheel_up event: which mouse\nbutton number does the system report when the mouse wheel is rolled one\nnotch up? x-wm-class string Specify the value to use for the res_class field of the window's\nWM_CLASS property. x-wm-class-name string Specify the value to use for the res_name field of the window's\nWM_CLASS property. Has no effect when x-wm-class is not set. yield-timeslice bool 0 Set this true to yield the timeslice at the end of the frame to be\nmore polite to other applications that are trying to run. z-order enum normal",
