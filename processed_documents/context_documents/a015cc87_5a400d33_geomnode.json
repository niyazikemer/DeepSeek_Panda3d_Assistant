  "content": "GeomNode\n\nFinally, .GeomNode is the glue that connects Geoms <geom> into the scene graph. A .GeomNode contains a list of one or more Geoms.\n\nGeomNode Geom RenderState Geom RenderState Geom RenderState\n\nThe .GeomNode class inherits from PandaNode <the-scene-graph>, so a GeomNode can be attached directly to the scene graph like any other node; and like any node, it inherits a transform and a render state from its parents in the scene graph. This transform and state is then applied to each of the node's Geoms.\n\nFurthermore, the GeomNode stores an additional render state definition for each Geom. This allows each Geom within a given GeomNode to have its own unique state; for instance, each Geom may have a different texture applied.\n\nWhen a model is loaded from an egg file, normally all the state definitions required to render the geometry will be stored on these per-Geom state definitions, rather than at the GeomNode level. These per-Geom states will override any state that is inherited from the scene graph, unless that scene graph state has a priority higher than the default priority of zero. (This is why it is necessary to specify a second parameter of 1 to the nodePath.setTexture() <.NodePath.setTexture> call, if you want to replace a texture that was applied to a model in the egg file.)",
