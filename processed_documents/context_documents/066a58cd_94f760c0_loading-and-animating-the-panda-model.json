  "content": "Loading and Animating the Panda Model\n\npython\n\nActors <loading-actors-and-animations>\n\nThe ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor class is for animated models. Note that we use ~direct.showbase.Loader.Loader.loadModel() for static models and ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor only when they are animated. The two constructor arguments for the ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor class are the name of the file containing the model and a Python dictionary containing the names of the files containing the animations.\n\nUpdate the Code\n\npython\n\nloading-and-animating-the-panda-model.py\n\nThe command loop(\"walk\") <direct.actor.Actor.Actor.loop> causes the walk animation to begin looping.\n\ncpp\n\nThe ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor class which is available to Python users is not available to C++ users. you should create your own Actor class which at least should do the following:\n\nload the Actor Model\n\nload the animations\n\nbind the model and the animations using AnimControl or AnimControlCollection\n\nThe next sample will load the panda model and the walk animation. the call: window->loop_animations(0); does the magic of binding all the loaded models and their animations under the node path: render . it's very important to note that any animations loaded after the above call will not show until the same method is called again. also any animations loaded under a node path which doesn't belong to render (for example: render_2d) will not show even if the call: window->loop_animations(0); is made. For such animations to show, other steps must be applied (more on this later).\n\nloading-and-animating-the-panda-model.cxx\n\nWe are first loading the model file and the animation file like ordinary models. Then, we are simply calling loop_animations(0) to loop all animations.\n\nRun the Program\n\nThe result is a panda walking in place as if on a treadmill:",
