  "content": "Particle Emitters\n\nThere are a large number of particle emitters, each categorized by the volume of space they represent. Additionally, all emitters have three modes: explicit, radiate, and custom. Explicit mode emits the particles in parallel in the same direction. Radiate mode emits particles away from a specific point. Custom mode emits particles with a velocity determined by the particular emitter. All emitters have a number of common parameters.\n\nVariable Definition Values emissionType Emission mode ET_EXPLICIT, ET_RADIATE, ET_CUSTOM explicitLaunchVector Initial velocity in explicit mode (x, y, z) radiateOrigin Point particles launch away from in radiate mode (x, y, z) amplitude Launch velocity multiplier (-infinity, infinity) amplitudeSpeed Spread for launch velocity multiplier [0, infinity)\n\nThe following list contains the different types of emitters, their unique parameters, and the effect of the custom mode.\n\nBoxEmitter\n\nVariable Definition Values minBound Minimum point for box volume (x, y, z) maxBound Maximum point for box volume (x, y, z)\n\nCustom mode generates particles with no initial velocity.\n\nDiscEmitter\n\nVariable Definition Values radius Radius of disc [0, infinity) outerAngle Particle launch angle at edge of disc [0, 360] innterAngle Particle launch angle at center of disc [0, 360] outerMagnitude Launch velocity multiplier at edge of disc (-infinity, infinity) innerMagnitude Launch velocity multiplier at center of disc (-infinity, infinity) cubicLerping Whether or not magnitude/angle interpolation is cubic Boolean\n\nCustom mode uses the last five parameters. Particles emitted from areas on the inside use interpolated magnitudes and angles, either liner or cubic.\n\nPointEmitter\n\nVariable Definition Values location Location of outer point (x, y, z)\n\nCustom mode generates particles with no initial velocity.\n\nRectangleEmitter\n\nVariable Definition Values minBound 2D point defining the rectangle (x, z) maxBound 2D point defining the rectangle (x, z)\n\nCustom mode generates particles with no initial velocity.\n\nRingEmitter\n\nVariable Definition Values radius Radius of disc [0, infinity) angle Particle launch angle [0, 360]\n\nCustom mode uses the second parameter to emit particles at an angle with respect to the vector from the ring center to the spawn point. 0 degrees emits particles away from the center, and 180 degrees emits particles into the center.\n\nSphereSurfaceEmitter\n\nVariable Definition Values radius Radius of sphere [0, infinity)\n\nCustom mode generates particles with no initial velocity.\n\nSphereVolumeEmitter\n\nVariable Definition Values radius Radius of sphere [0, infinity)\n\nCustom mode emits particles away from the sphere center. Their velocity is dependent on their spawn location within the sphere. It is 0 at the center, of magnitude 1 at the outer edge of the sphere, and linearly interpolated in between.\n\nTangentRingEmitter\n\nVariable Definition Values radius Radius of ring [0, infinity)\n\nCustom mode emits particles tangentially to the ring edge, with a velocity magnitude of 1.",
