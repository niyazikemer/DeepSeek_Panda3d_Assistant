Additional documentation can be found by clicking on the name of the RenderAttrib.\n\nAlphaTestAttrib <alpha-testing>: Hides part of the model, based on the texture's alpha channel.\n\nAntialiasAttrib <antialiasing>: Controls full-screen antialiasing and polygon-edge antialiasing.\n\nAudioVolumeAttrib: Applies a scale to audio volume for positional sounds.\n\nAuxBitplaneAttrib <auxiliary-bitplane-control>: Causes shader generator to produce extra data.\n\nClipPlaneAttrib <clip-planes>: Slices off a piece of the model, using a clipping plane.\n\nColorAttrib <tinting-and-recoloring>: Tints the model. Only works if the model is not illuminated.\n\nColorBlendAttrib <transparency-and-blending>: This specifies how colors are blended into the frame buffer, for special effects.\n\nColorScaleAttrib <tinting-and-recoloring>: Modulates vertex colors with a flat color.\n\nColorWriteAttrib <color-write-masks>: Causes the model to not affect the R, G, B, or A channel of the framebuffer.\n\nCullBinAttrib: Controls the order in which Panda renders geometry.\n\nCullFaceAttrib <backface-culling-and-frontface-culling>: Causes backfaces or frontfaces of the model to be visible.\n\nDepthOffsetAttrib: Causes the Z-buffer to treat the object as if it were closer or farther.\n\nDepthTestAttrib <depth-test-and-depth-write>: Alters the way the Z-buffer affects the model.\n\nDepthWriteAttrib <depth-test-and-depth-write>: Controls whether or not the model affects the Z-buffer.\n\nFogAttrib <fog>: Causes the model to be obscured by fog if it is far from the camera.\n\nLightAttrib <lighting>: Causes the model to be illuminated by certain lights.\n\nLightRampAttrib <light-ramps>: Enables HDR tone mapping or cartoon shading.\n\nMaterialAttrib <materials>: Changes the way the model reflects light.\n\nRenderModeAttrib: Used to enable wireframe rendering.\n\nRescaleNormalAttrib: Can disable the automatic correction of non-unit normals.\n\nShadeModelAttrib: Can cause the model to appear faceted instead of smooth.\n\nShaderAttrib <shaders>: Gives almost unlimited control, but difficult to use.\n\nStencilAttrib <stencil-attribute>: Causes the model to affect the stencil buffer, or be affected by the stencil buffer.\n\nTexGenAttrib <automatic-texture-coordinates>: Causes the system to synthesize texture coordinates for the model.\n\nTexMatrixAttrib <texture-transforms>: Alters the existing texture coordinates.\n\nTextureAttrib <texturing>: Applies a texture map to the model.\n\nTransparencyAttrib <transparency-and-blending>: Causes the model to be partially transparent.\n\nUndocumented\n\nUnfortunately, the Panda3D manual is still a work in progress: there are many aspects of it that are not fully documented yet. These attributes are not yet documented:\n\nAudioVolumeAttrib, CullBinAttrib, DepthOffsetAttrib, RenderModeAttrib, RescaleNormalAttrib, ShadeModelAttrib\n\nHowever, although the manual does not document these classes, the reference documentation does.",
