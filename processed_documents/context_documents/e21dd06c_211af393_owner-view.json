  "content": "Owner View\n\nNote\n\nThis type of object is currently not directly available in Panda3D. It was implemented in the former project developed by Disney and can also be used with available open source extensions like the Astron suite.\n\nOwner View (OV) objects are special implementations for DOs that are created and used on the clients. OVs are very similar to AIs in that they handle game logic but instead of being implemented on the server, they are introduced on the client side. That way clients can directly update fields in these objects. To do so, the respective calls must be marked with the ownsend tag in the dc definition file.",
