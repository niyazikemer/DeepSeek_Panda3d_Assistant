  "content": "Work groups\n\nNormally, a regular shader is executed on a predetermined set of data (such as an amount of vertices or pixels), in which case the amount of shader invocations is known beforehand. However, since compute shaders can operate on an arbitrary set of data, the amount of invocations has to be explicitly specified.\n\nCompute shader invocations are divided up in batches called work groups, which specify how many invocations happen simultaneously. The different invocations in a work group may occur at the same time, but you should never rely on the different work groups being executed in a particular order or simultaneous to each other; this is up to the graphics driver to decide.",
