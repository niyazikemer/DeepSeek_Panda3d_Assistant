  "content": "Bam files (with the extension .bam), on the other hand, are binary files that are more closely tied to a particular version of Panda3D. The bam format is designed to be as similar as possible to the actual Panda data structures, so that a bam file is relatively small and can be loaded very quickly. However, you should not consider the bam file format to be a good long-term storage format for your models, since a future version of Panda3D may not be able to load bam files from older versions. (That said, we have been pretty good at retaining backward compatibility for .bam files anyway, so you may find it possible to ignore this advice, albeit at your peril.)",
