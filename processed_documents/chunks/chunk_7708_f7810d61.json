You have successfully compiled your own Panda3D program!\n\nNote\n\nOn macOS, Panda3D versions 1.10.4.1 and below were compiled with libstdc++, and so require passing -stdlib=libstdc++ to the compiler. Panda3D 1.10.5 offers a choice: the download marked \"MacOSX10.6\" is compiled with libstdc++, whereas the download marked \"MacOSX10.9\" is compiled with libc++. It is recommended to use the download marked \"MacOSX10.9\".",
