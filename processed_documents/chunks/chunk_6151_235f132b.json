  "content": "When calling interrogate, you will need to include the -oc and -od options, which specify where the generated code and function tables, respectively, will be written.\n\nThe -module and -library options are used to specify the name of your module and library. These options are mainly code-organizational. You can omit both options.\n\nWith -D you can ignore or make interrogate interpret symbols differently. For example, if your code uses a non-standard C macro like __inline, you would need to call interrogate with -D__inline. Or, if you would like certain defines to be defined differently, you can use -Ddefvar=value.",
