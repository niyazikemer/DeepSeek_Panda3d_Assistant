  "content": "Wavefront .obj\n\nThere is a tool provided with Panda3D called obj2egg which can convert Wavefront .obj files to .egg. However, this tool is extremely limited and does not support scene hierarchy, materials, or textures, among other things. It is recommended to convert the .obj file to another format first, or to load the .obj file directly into Panda3D using the Assimp plug-in <assimp-loader>.\n\nOther Formats\n\nThere are several tools included with Panda that can convert various file formats into egg file format:\n\nlwo2egg\n\ndxf2egg\n\nflt2egg\n\nvrml2egg\n\nx2egg\n\nNote that Panda can load any of these file formats without conversion, doing so causes the conversion to occur at runtime.\n\nAlso, be aware that many of these file formats are limited. Most do not include bone or animation data. Some do not store normals. Currently the DirectX (.x) format is the only one of these that stores bones, joints and animations.",
