  "content": "Actor Intervals\n\npython\n\nActor intervals allow actor animations to be played as an interval, which allows them to be combined with other intervals through sequences and parallels.\n\nThe subrange of the animation to be played may be specified via frames (startFrame up to and including endFrame) or seconds (startTime up to and including endTime). It may also be specified with a startFrame or startTime in conjunction with the duration, in seconds. If none of these is specified, then the default is to play the entire range of the animation.\n\nIf endFrame is before startFrame, or if the play rate is negative, then the animation will be played backwards.\n\nYou may specify a subrange that is longer than the actual animation, but if you do so, you probably also want to specify either loop=1 or constrainedLoop=1; see below.",
