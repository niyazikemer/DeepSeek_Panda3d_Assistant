For complete documentation, please see the Egg Syntax documentation from the Panda3D source code repository.\n\nGeneral Syntax\n\nEgg files consist of a series of sequential and hierarchically-nested entries. In general, the syntax of each entry is:\n\n<Entry-type>\u00a0name\u00a0{\u00a0contents\u00a0}\n\nComment text should be enclosed in quotation marks:\n\n<Comment>\u00a0{\u00a0text\u00a0}\n\nLocal Information Entries\n\nThese nodes contain information relevant to the current level of nesting only:\n\n<Scalar>\u00a0name\u00a0{\u00a0value\u00a0}\n\nScalars are attributes of the entry the Scalar is in. Name is the attribute name with value as the contents of that attribute.\n\nGlobal Information Entries",
