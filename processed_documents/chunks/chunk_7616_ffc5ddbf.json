  "content": "This does mean that your materials need to be structured in a certain way in order for them to be converted correctly. For example, you must use the Principled BSDF shader node in your materials, and connect its output directly to the Surface input of the Material Output node. More information on the limitations of the Blender exporter can be found in the Blender manual (though note that not all features mentioned here are supported by Panda3D):\n\nhttps://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/import_export/scene_gltf2.html\n\nPBR Rendering\n\nBlender 2.80 and above use a physically-based rendering model to render materials. As of this time of writing, Panda3D's shader generator does not implement such a rendering model. If you wish to get a rendering result that approaches the way the model appears in Blender, you need to use a shader that applies lighting in a similar way to Blender.",
