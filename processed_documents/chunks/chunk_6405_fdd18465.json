  "content": "cpp\n\nTODO\n\nFirst we create a nurbs curve (NurbsCurveEvaluator), and then we link this nurbs curve to the soft body rope node. The soft body node will update the nurbs curve every frame from now on.\n\nBut we are not done yet. We still need to create something that can be seen in the scene graph. A RopeNode can render a NurbsCurveEvaluator. For details on how to configure the RopeNode please refer to the Panda3D API documentation; both the RopeNode and the NurbsCurveEvaluator are not part of the panda3d.bullet, but core Panda3D classes.\n\nAttaching the rope\n\nNow we have created a rope, and we can render it. Next we want to attach the rope to something, that is \"glue\" it either to some other object, usually a rigid body, or to a specific position of the world.",
