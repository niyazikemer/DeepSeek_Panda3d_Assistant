  "content": "Lerp Intervals\n\nThe \"lerp interval\" is the main workhorse of the Interval system. The word \"lerp\" is short for \"linearly interpolate\" and means to smoothly adjust properties, such as position, from one value to another over a period of time. You can use lerp intervals to move and rotate objects around in your world. The lerp interval is also the most complex of all of the intervals, since there are many different parameters that you might want to specify to control the lerp.\n\npython\n\nAn overview of the NodePath-based LerpIntervals\n\nMost LerpIntervals adjust the various transform properties of a NodePath, such as pos, hpr, and scale, and they all have a similar form. Consider the LerpPosInterval, which will smoothly move a model from one point in space to another:",
