  "content": "Since an orthographic lens doesn't have a field of view angle, the lens.set_fov() <.Lens.set_fov> method does nothing. To adjust the amount that the orthographic lens sees, you must adjust its film size. And unlike a .PerspectiveLens, the film size units are not arbitrary--for an .OrthographicLens, the film size should be specified in spatial units, the same units you used to model your scene. For instance, the film size of the .OrthographicLens in the above illustration was set with the call lens.set_film_size(20, 15) <.Lens.set_film_size>, which sets the film size to 20 feet by 15 feet--because the scene is modeled in feet, and the panda is about 12 feet tall.",
