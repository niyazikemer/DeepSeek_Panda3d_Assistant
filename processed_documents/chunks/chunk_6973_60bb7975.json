For instance, a custom column for storing indices might be required for a shader you want to apply to your model. More commonly, you will want the vertex format to support 8-bit integer color components. In this case, it is no longer possible to assign the values directly; they have to be converted to bytes.\n\nAs an example, here is some code that makes use of the .GeomVertexFormat.get_v3n3c4t2() format:\n\nimport struct",
