  "content": "There are also additional, optional parameters to makeCubeMap():\n\nNote that we passed a new NodePath, called rig in the above example, to the makeCubeMap() call. This NodePath serves as the \"camera rig\"; the makeCubeMap() method will create six cameras facing in six different directions, and attach them all to the camera rig. Thus, you can parent this rig into your scene and move it around as if it were a six-eyed camera. Normally, for environment maps, you would parent the rig somewhere within your shiny object so it can look out of the shiny object and see the things that should be reflected in it.\n\nThe actual cube map itself be retrieved with the call:\n\ntex = buffer.getTexture()\n\nYou can apply the texture to geometry as in the previous example <environment-mapping-with-cube-maps>. You should use the MWorldCubeMap mode to generate texture coordinates for your geometry since the camera rig will have a CompassEffect <compass-effects> on it to keep it unrotated with respect to render.",
