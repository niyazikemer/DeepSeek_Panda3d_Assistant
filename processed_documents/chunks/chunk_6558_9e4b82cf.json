  "content": "interval.setPlayRate(playRate)\n\nWith this you can change the play rate of the interval when it is already running.\n\nFinally, there are a handful of handy query methods:\n\ninterval.getDuration()\n\nReturns the length of the interval in seconds.\n\ninterval.getT()\n\nReturns the current elapsed time within the interval, since the beginning of the interval.\n\ninterval.isPlaying()\n\nReturns true if the interval is currently playing, or false if it was not started, has already finished, or has been explicitly paused or finished.\n\ninterval.isStopped()\n\nReturns true if the interval has not been started, has already played to its completion, or has been explicitly stopped via finish(). This is not quite the same this as (not interval.isPlaying()), since it does not return true for a paused interval.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nlerp-intervals function-intervals actor-intervals sound-intervals sequences-and-parallels motion-paths particle-intervals projectile-intervals",
