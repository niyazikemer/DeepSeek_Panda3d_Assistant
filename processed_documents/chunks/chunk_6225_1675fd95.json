Typically it would be something like \"Femur\", or \"Neck\", or \"L Finger1\". This is usually set inside the modeling package. For example, in MAX, each object in the scene has a name, including the bones. If necessary, you can determine the joint names by scanning the egg file for strings like <Joint> Femur or, in the case of a glTF file, by looking at the \"name\" property in the \"nodes\" array. The call actor.listJoints() <direct.actor.Actor.Actor.listJoints> can also be used to show the complete hierarchy of joints.\n\npython\n\nTo undo a previous ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.controlJoint() call, use the ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.releaseJoint() method:\n\nactor.releaseJoint(\"modelRoot\", \"Joint Name\")\n\ncpp",
