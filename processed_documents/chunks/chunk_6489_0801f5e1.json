  "content": "Various exporters are able to automatically generate optimized collision geometry during the export process. Consult the documentation for your exporter to find out how to do this.\n\nWhen you have constructed the optimized collision geometry, don't forget to disable checking for collision against the visible geometry, by setting the collision-bitmasks appropriately.\n\nLack of Hierarchy\n\nA naive approach for exporting collisions for a large scene is just to put all of the collision solids under a single .CollisionNode, or perhaps many .CollisionNode objects under a single parent node.\n\nThis is very inefficient for a large number of solids. Panda3D will need to test for collisions against every single object in a row.",
