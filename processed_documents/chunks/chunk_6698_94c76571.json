They can take command-line arguments, display output directly to the console and do not require setting log_filename.\n\nIncluding Assets\n\nMost applications have assets that need to be included separately with the application. These are not included by default, since Panda3D doesn't know which files are necessary for an application or which ones are source assets or development files that should not be distributed.\n\nThe include_patterns key can be used to specify a list of files or patterns to include with the application. This does not need to be used for Python files, which are compiled into the executable itself, and are not included separately. The pattern is quite flexible:\n\n'include_patterns': [\n    # Path to a specific file\n    'CREDITS.txt',",
