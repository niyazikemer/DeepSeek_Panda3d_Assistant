It ensures that the created node will move smoothly from one point to the next when moved on the client.\n\nThis DO can be used if the repository has been initialized with the direct.dc added to the dc files list.\n\nTo make use of the smoothing functionality and automatic broadcasting of position and rotation changes to other players, a few functions have to be called.\n\n.DistributedSmoothNode.activateSmoothing(smoothing, prediction)",
