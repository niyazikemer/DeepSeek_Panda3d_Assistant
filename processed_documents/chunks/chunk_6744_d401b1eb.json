  "content": "ColorAttrib::T_flat attribute set: that is, geometry that uses the scene\ngraph color instead of per-vertex color. Normally Panda will do this as\nan optimization for Geoms whose vertices are all the same color, or all\nwhite. This allows the removal of the color attribute from the vertices\nwhere it is not necessary to specify colors per-vertex. If this is\nfalse, the color attribute will always be specified per-vertex, even if\nall vertices have the same value. egg-flat-shading bool 0 Set this true to allow the egg loader to create geometry with the\nShadeModelAttrib::M_flat attribute set. It will do this only for\ngeometry that has per-polygon normals and/or colors. This allows the egg\nloader to avoid duplicating vertices when they are shared between\nconnected polygons with different normals or colors, but it prevents the\nflat-shaded geometry from being combined with any adjacent smooth-shaded\ngeometry (for instance, as the result of a flatten_strong operation).
