  "content": "If a NodePath that is controlled by an ActorNode also needs collision calculations done upon it, be sure to use the ~panda3d.physics.PhysicsCollisionHandler instead of .CollisionHandlerPusher. More info can be found in the section on collision-handlers. If you intend to use a PhysicsCollisionHandler to prevent a model from falling through a floor (for example, if the scene has gravity applied), be sure to look at the friction coefficient options on the ~panda3d.physics.PhysicsCollisionHandler.",
