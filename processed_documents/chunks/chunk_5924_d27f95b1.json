  "content": "It is the (u, v) texture coordinates that you assign to the vertices that determine how the texture map will be applied to your model. When each triangle of your model is drawn, it is drawn with the colors from your texture map that fall within the same triangle of vertices in (u, v) texture map space. For instance, the sample smiley.egg model that ships with Panda has its vertices defined such that the u coordinate increases from 0 to 1 around its diameter, and the v coordinate increases from 0 at the bottom to 1 at the top. This causes the texture image to be wrapped horizontally around the sphere:\n\nNote that the (u, v) range for a texture image is always the same, 0 to 1, regardless of the size of the texture.",
