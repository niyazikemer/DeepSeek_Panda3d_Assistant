This is best done using a task, and keeping the current steering angle around somewhere in a variable.\n\nHere we use a very simple model of controlling the steering angle. If 'turnLeft' or 'turnRight' keys are pressed the steering angle will increase/decrease at a constant rate, until a maximum steering angle is achieved. No relaxation is applied. Therefor we also define constants for the maximum steering angle (here: steeringClamp) and the rate at which the steering angle increases/decreases (here: steeringIncrement).",
