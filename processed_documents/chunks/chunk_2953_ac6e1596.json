The Q-units are the smallest packable unit;\n        # increasing self.quantize therefore reduces the visual\n        # packing resolution correspondingly.  Q-units very roughly\n        # correspond to pixels onscreen (they may be larger, sometimes\n        # considerably larger, than 1 pixel, depending on the window\n        # size).\n\n\n        # This number defines the size of a Q-unit square, in texture\n        # bytes.  It is automatically adjusted in repack() based on\n        # the window size and the texture memory size.\n        self.quantize = 1",
