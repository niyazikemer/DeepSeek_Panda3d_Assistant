  "content": "Set the object type to the desired value.\n\nObject Type Meaning barrier The geometry defined at this root and below defines an invisible\ncollision solid. trigger The geometry defined at this root and below defines an invisible\ntrigger surface. sphere The geometry is replaced with the smallest collision sphere that\nwill enclose it. Typically you model a sphere in polygons and put this\nflag on it to create a collision sphere of the same size. tube As in sphere, above, but the geometry is replaced with a collision\ntube (a capsule). Typically you will model a capsule or a cylinder in\npolygons. bubble A collision bubble is placed around the geometry, which is otherwise\nunchanged. ghost It means that the geometry beginning at this node and below should\nnever be collided with--characters will pass through it. backstage It means that the geometry at this node and below should not be\ntranslated. This will normally be used on scale references and other\nmodeling tools.\n\nRunning the Exporter",
