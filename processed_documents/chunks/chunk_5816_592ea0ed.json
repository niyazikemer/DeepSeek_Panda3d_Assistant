Especially effective in conjunction with\nassimp-optimize-graph and assimp-remove-redundant-materials. assimp-optimize-graph false Optimizes the scene geometry by flattening the scene hierarchy. This\nis very efficient (combined with assimp-optimize-meshes), but it may\nresult the hierarchy to become lost, so it is disabled by default. assimp-flip-winding-order false Set this true to flip the winding order of all loaded geometry. assimp-gen-normals false Set this true to generate normals (if absent from file) on\nimport. assimp-smooth-normal-angle 0.0 Set this to anything other than 0.0 in degrees (so 180.0 is PI) to\nspecify the maximum angle that may be between two face normals at the\nsame vertex position that are smoothed together. Sometimes referred to\nas 'crease angle'. Only has effect if assimp-gen-normals is set to true",
