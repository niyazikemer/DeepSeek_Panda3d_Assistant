  "content": "Clip Planes\n\nA clip plane fundamentally divides space into two halves: one half which is clipped (hidden from rendering), and one half which is rendered.\n\nA common use case is when rendering reflections of flat mirror surfaces (such as water), to ensure that a camera that is rendering the reflected scene will only render the part of the scene that is above the surface of the mirror.\n\nIt is possible to have multiple clip planes enabled at the same time. This will cause multiple areas to be culled away. There is an implementation-specific limit on the number of clip planes that can be active at any one time.\n\nA plane is defined by four coordinates. The first three represent the X, Y, Z of the plane's surface normal. The last parameter is used to determine the origin point of the plane. You can create a plane either using three points, or by using a normal vector and an origin point:\n\npython",
