  "content": "Panda3D's Software License\n\nSince version 1.5.3, Panda3D has been released under the so-called \"Modified BSD license,\" which is a free software license with very few restrictions on usage. In versions 1.5.2 and before, it used a proprietary license which was very similar in intention to the BSD and MIT licenses, though there was some disagreement about the freeness of two of the clauses. The old license can still be accessed here.\n\nAlthough the engine itself is completely free, it comes with various third-party libraries that are not free software. Some of them (like FMOD) even restrict you from using them in commercial games unless you have licensed copies. Because of this reason, Panda3D makes it easy to disable or remove these restricted third-party libraries, and most of the time it offers an alternative. For example, it also comes with OpenAL which you can use instead of FMOD.\n\nYou can read Panda3D's License.\n\nWho is Working on Panda3D",
