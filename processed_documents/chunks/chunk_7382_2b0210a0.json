  "content": "inv = CollisionInvSphere(cx, cy, cz, radius)\n\nCollisionPlane\n\nThe CollisionPlane is an infinite plane extending in all directions. It is not often used, but it can be useful in certain cases, for instance as a trigger placed below the ground to detect when an avatar has accidentally slipped through a crack in the world. You can also build a box out of six planes to keep objects perfectly constrained within a rectangular region, similar to an inverse sphere; such a box is much more reliable than one constructed of six polygons.\n\nThe plane actually divides the universe into two spaces: the space behind the plane, which is all considered solid, and the space in front of the plane, which is all empty. Thus, if an object is anywhere behind a plane, no matter how far, it is considered to be intersecting the plane.",
