The messenger typically does not print out when every event occurs. Toggling verbose mode will make the messenger print every event it receives. Toggling it again will revert it to the default. A number of methods exist for checking to see what object is checking for what event, but the print method will show who is accepting each event. Also, if accepts keep changing to the point where it is too confusing, the clear method will start the messenger over with a clear dictionary.\n\nmessenger.toggleVerbose()\nprint(messenger)\nmessenger.clear()\n\nSending Custom Events\n\nCustom events can be sent by the script using the code\n\nmessenger.send('Event Name')",
