DirectGui has a special mechanism to connect it to the mouse pointer, which requires that all of its interactive objects be attached directly or indirectly to a PGTop node. In the default main window, this PGTop node is aspect2d, a special node created both to compensate for the non-square aspect ratio of the window, and also to be the special PGTop node required by DirectGui. If you are creating your own 2-D scene graph, you can create your own aspect2d node something like this:\n\naspectRatio = base.getAspectRatio()\nmyAspect2d = myRender2d.attachNewNode(PGTop('myAspect2d'))\nmyAspect2d.setScale(1.0 / aspectRatio, 1.0, 1.0)\nmyAspect2d.node().setMouseWatcher(base.mouseWatcherNode)",
