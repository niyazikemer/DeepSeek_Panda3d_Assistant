  "content": "Lenses and Field of View\n\nEvery Camera has a Lens object that defines the properties of its view. For simple applications, you do not need to think about the lens; you will probably be happy with the default lens properties. However, you will occasionally want to adjust some properties of the lens, such as its field of view, and there are several interfaces to do this, depending on how you want to think about the lens.\n\npython\n\nWhen you start ShowBase, a default camera and lens are created for you automatically. The default camera object is stored in base.cam <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.cam> (although by convention, if you want to move the default camera you should manipulate base.camera <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.camera> instead), and the default lens is base.camLens <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.camLens>.",
