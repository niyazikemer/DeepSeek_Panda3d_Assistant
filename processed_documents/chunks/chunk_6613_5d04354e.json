  "content": "It's worth pointing out that the only thing we have improved here is frame throughput--the total number of frames per second that the system can render. This approach does nothing to improve frame latency, or the total time that elapses between the time some change happens in the game, and the time it appears onscreen. This might be one reason to avoid this approach, if latency is more important than throughput. However, we're still talking about a total latency that's usually less than 100ms or so, which is faster than human response time anyway; and most applications (including games) can tolerate a small amount of latency like this in exchange for a smooth, fast frame rate.",
