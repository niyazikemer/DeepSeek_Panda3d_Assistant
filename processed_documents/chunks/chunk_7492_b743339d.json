  "content": "Initially, before the PStatClient has established a connection, calls to start() and stop() simply return immediately.\n\nWhen you call .PStatClient.connect(), the client attempts to contact the PStatServer via a TCP connection to the hostname and port named in the pstats-host and pstats-port Config.prc variables, respectively. (The default hostname and port are localhost and 5185.) You can also pass in a specific hostname and/or port to the connect() call. Upon successful connection and handshake with the server, the PStatClient sends a list of the available collectors, along with their names, colors, and hierarchical relationships, on the TCP channel.",
