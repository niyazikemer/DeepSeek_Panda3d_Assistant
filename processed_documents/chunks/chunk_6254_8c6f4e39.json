  "content": "Each .TextureStage can hold one texture image for a particular model. If you assign a texture to a particular TextureStage, and then later (or at a lower node) assign a different texture to the same TextureStage, the new texture completely replaces the old one. (Within the overall scene, a given TextureStage can be used to hold any number of different textures for different nodes; but it only holds one texture for any one particular node.)\n\nHowever, you can have as many different TextureStages as you want. If you create a new TextureStage and use it to assign a second texture to a node, then the node now has both textures assigned to it.",
