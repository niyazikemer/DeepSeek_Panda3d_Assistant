Type may be any word, and a Config definition will be searched for by the name \"egg-object-type-word\", where \"word\" is the type word. This definition may contain any arbitrary egg syntax to be parsed in at this group level.\n\nA number of predefined ObjectType definitions are provided:\n\nJoint Nodes\n\n<Joint> name {\n  [transform]\n  [ref-list]\n  [joint-list]\n}\n\nA joint is a highly specialized kind of grouping node. A tree of joints is used to specify the skeletal structure of an animated character.\n\nA joint may only contain one of three things. It may contain a <Transform> entry, as above, which defines the joint's unanimated (rest) position; it may contain lists of assigned vertices or CV's; and it may contain other joints.",
