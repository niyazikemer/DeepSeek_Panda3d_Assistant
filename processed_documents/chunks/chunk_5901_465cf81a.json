  "content": "You may change the near distance at any time with the call lens.set_near(distance) <.Lens.set_near>.\n\nD. This is the far distance or far plane of the lens. Similar to the near distance, objects that are farther than this from the camera plane will not be rendered. You may set this as large as you like, but like the near distance, setting it too large may result in Z-fighting. (However, the near distance value has a much greater impact on Z-fighting than the far distance value, because of the nature of the math involved.) The default far distance is 1000.0, which is appropriate for small scenes; you may need to set it larger if you have a large scene.\n\nYou may change the far distance with the call lens.set_far(distance) <.Lens.set_far>. Since the near distance and far distance are often changed at the same time, there is a convenience function to set then both: lens.set_near_far(near_dist, far_dist) <.Lens.set_near_far>",
