It is used by the dae2egg utility, which converts COLLADA files into Egg files. See converting-to-egg.\n\nThe FCollada library is discontinued and no longer being maintained. Support will likely be removed in a future version of Panda3D.\n\nLicense: MIT License\n\nFFTW2\n\nhttp://www.fftw.org\n\nFast Fourier Transforms library for lossy animation compression in bam files. Compressed animation files may be as small as 10% of the uncompressed animation, but this is only an on-disk and/or download savings.\n\nUse of fftw in Panda is deprecated.
