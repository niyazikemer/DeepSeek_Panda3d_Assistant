In this tutorial, the position and texture attributes of various objects will be altered over time to give life to a carousel. The most common intervals for doing simple movement of objects are the posInterval and hprInterval. These intervals will change the position/orientation of an object (or node) over a given time and given displacement/rotation, respectively. Another interval we will look at is the LerpFunc interval. LerpFunc will call a function and give it a linearly interpolated value range over a specified time range. This is how we will oscilate pandas via a sin wave and alternate textures over time. For more information on intervals, please refer to the intervals section of the online manual.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
