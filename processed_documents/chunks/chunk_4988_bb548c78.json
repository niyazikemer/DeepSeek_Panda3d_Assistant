Otherwise, if defaultFilename is False,\n        the entire namePrefix is taken to be the filename to write,\n        and this string should include a suitable filename extension\n        that will be used to determine the type of image file to\n        write.\n\n        Normally, the source is a GraphicsWindow, GraphicsBuffer or\n        DisplayRegion.  If a Texture is supplied instead, it must have\n        a ram image (that is, if it was generated by\n        makeTextureBuffer() or makeCubeMap(), the parameter toRam\n        should have been set true).  If it is a cube map texture as\n        generated by makeCubeMap(), namePrefix should contain the hash\n        mark ('#') character.",
