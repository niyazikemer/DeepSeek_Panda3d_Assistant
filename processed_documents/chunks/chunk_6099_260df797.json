  "content": "Any Python objects to be mapped for distributed networking should be imported here. A modified python syntax is used. In the first line DistributedObject.py and DistributedObjectAI.py will be mapped.\n\nThe /AI can also be used for module/filenames like this.\n\nfrom someManager.DSomeManager/AI import DSomeManager/AI\n\nThis will import the DSomeManager class from someManager.DSomeManager.py and DSomeManagerAI from someManager.DsomeManagerAI.py.\n\nVariables\n\nint8, int16, int32, and int64: Signed integer values and bit size\n\nuint8, uint16, uint32, and uint64: For unsigned integers\n\nfloat64: A C double, for floating point numbers\n\nstring: An arbitrary string up to 64k in length. Obviously bandwidth intensive so avoid for frequent communication\n\nchar: Same as int8 but will be realized as a character\n\nblob: String but arbitrary byte sequence usually not intended for print or something encoded that is too complicated for the normal dc system\n\nStructures can also be identified as well.",
