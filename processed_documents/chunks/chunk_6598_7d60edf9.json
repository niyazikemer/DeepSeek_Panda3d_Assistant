  "content": "Certain kinds of numeric conversions are performed automatically, according to the column's designated contents. For instance, if you store a floating-point value into an integer column, the fractional part of the value is usually truncated. However, if the column contents indicates that it represents a color value, then the floating-point value is automatically scaled from the range 0.0 .. 1.0 into the full numeric range of the column's integer value. This allows you to store color components in the range 0.0 .. 1.0, and get the expected result (that is, the value is scaled into the range 0 .. 255). A similar conversion happens when data is read.\n\nThere are no getData2i, 3i, or 4i methods available, simply because Panda does not currently define a multi-component integer value that can be returned to Python. Since most multi-component column types are floating-point, or can be expressed as floating-point, this is not generally a limitation.",
