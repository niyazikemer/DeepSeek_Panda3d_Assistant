There is no technical reason for this limitation, but very\nlarge numbers are probably a mistake, so this can be used as a simple\nsanity check. Set it larger or smaller to suit your needs. max-occlusion-vertices int 3000 The maximum number of vertices that may be included in a PandaNode\nand its descendents in order to perform an occlusion query for it.\nSubgraphs whose total vertex count exceeds this number will be\nsubdivided further before performing an occlusion test--the hope is that\nwe can eventually get to a finer-grained answer. GeomNodes and Geoms\nwill not be subdivided, regardless of this limit. max-resident-vertex-data int -1 Specifies the maximum number of bytes of all vertex data that is\nallowed to remain resident in system RAM at one time.
