Set this false just to triangulate everything into\nindependent triangles. egg-min-tfan-tris int 4 The minimum number of triangles that must be involved in order to\ngenerate a triangle fan. Fewer than this is just interrupting a triangle\nstrip. egg-normal-scale double 1.0 egg-object-type-barrier string <Collide> { Polyset descend } (from Confauto.prc);",
