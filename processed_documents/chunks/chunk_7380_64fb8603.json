  "content": "Also, a sphere is a particularly good choice for use as a \"from\" object, because a sphere can reliably be tested for collision with most of the other solid types. The \"from\" objects are the objects that are considered the active objects in the world; see collision-traversers. A sphere is usually the best choice to put around the player's avatar, for instance. The sphere also makes a good \"into\" object; it is the only object type that is a good choice for both \"from\" and \"into\" objects.\n\nA sphere is defined in terms of a center and a radius. Note that, like any object, the sphere's coordinates are defined in the sphere's own coordinate space, so that often the center is (0, 0, 0).\n\nsphere = CollisionSphere(cx, cy, cz, radius)\n\nCollisionCapsule\n\nA \"capsule\" is a cylinder with hemispherical endcaps, also known as a spherocylinder. Note that before Panda3D 1.10, this shape was called \"CollisionTube\", and this name remains as an alias for backward compatibility.",
