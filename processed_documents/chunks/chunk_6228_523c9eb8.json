If the texture is not found or cannot be read for some reason, None is returned.\n\nNote that the Texture class is reference counted <reference-counting>, so it is necessary to use a smart PT(Texture) pointer to ensure that it is not automatically deleted by the garbage collector.\n\nOnce you have a texture, you can apply it to a model with the ~.NodePath.set_texture() call. For instance, suppose you used the .CardMaker class to generate a plain white card:\n\npython\n\ncm = CardMaker('card')\ncard = render.attachNewNode(cm.generate())\n\ncpp\n\nCardMaker cm(\"card\");\nNodePath card = render.attach_new_node(cm.generate());",
