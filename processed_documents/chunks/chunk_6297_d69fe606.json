When you\u2019ve finished this, click OK.\n\nClick the Choose button next to the text box labeled \u201cMaya file to be exported\u201d and select the .mb file that you would like to export.\n\nSelect the version of Maya you currently have on your system from the Maya Version drop-down box.\n\nNow, before you click Run Export, you must decide if you want to export any animation from the file and if so what type. If you simply want a static model (usually used for props and game levels) select \u201cnone\u201d in the Animation box. This will export only the geometry from your scene, excluding any joints or key frames. It should be noted that this type of model will not export any skinning data from Maya. However, it will still have a transform included which will allow it to be placed in a Panda3D world.",
