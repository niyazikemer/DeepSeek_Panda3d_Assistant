  "content": "Note that the shiny highlights are now quite subtle, but still compelling, especially when you see the car move.\n\nThe sphere map technique isn't perfect. The biggest problem with it is that you have to prepare it ahead of time, which means you have to know exactly what will be reflected in your shiny objects--it's impossible for an object to reflect a dynamic object (for instance, an adjacent car).\n\nAnother problem is that the point-of-view is baked into the sphere map, so that if the camera were to swing around to view the car from the other side, the things you could see in the reflection would still be the objects behind the camera on this side.\n\nBoth of these problems can be solved by cube mapping <cube-maps>, which is a more advanced technique for, among other things, applying environment maps. However, cube maps aren't always ideal; very often, the venerable sphere map really is the best choice.",
