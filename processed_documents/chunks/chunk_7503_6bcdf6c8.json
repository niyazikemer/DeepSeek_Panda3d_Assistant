  "content": "Bullet Continuous Collision Detection\n\nCCD is short for Continuous Collision Detection, which is a workaround for a common problem in game physics: a fast moving body might not collide with an obstacle if in one frame it is \"before\" the obstacle, and in the next one it is already \"behind\" the obstacle. At no frame the fast moving body overlaps with the obstacle, and thus no response is created. This is what CCD is for. CCD checks for collisions in between frames, and thus can prevent fast moving objects from passing through thin obstacles.\n\nBullet has built-in support for CCD, but bodies have to be configured properly to enable CCD checks.",
