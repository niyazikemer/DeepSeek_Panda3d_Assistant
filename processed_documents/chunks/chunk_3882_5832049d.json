  "content": "name (str): the name to assign to the Task.  Required,\n                unless you are passing in a Task object that already has\n                a name.\n\n            extraArgs (list): the list of arguments to pass to the task\n                function.  If this is omitted, the list is just the task\n                object itself.\n\n            appendTask (bool): If this is true, then the task object\n                itself will be appended to the end of the extraArgs list\n                before calling the function.\n\n            sort (int): the sort value to assign the task.  The default\n                sort is 0.  Within a particular task chain, it is\n                guaranteed that the tasks with a lower sort value will\n                all run before tasks with a higher sort value run.",
