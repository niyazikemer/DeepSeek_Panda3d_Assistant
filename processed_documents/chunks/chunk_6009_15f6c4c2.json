  "content": "The GraphicsPipe object isn't often used directly, except to create the individual GraphicsWindow and GraphicsBuffer objects.\n\nGraphicsWindow and GraphicsBuffer\n\nThe .GraphicsWindow class is the class that represents a single onscreen window for rendering. Panda normally opens a default window for you at startup, which is available in base.win. You can create as many additional windows as you like. (Note, however, that some graphics drivers incur a performance penalty when multiple windows are open simultaneously.)\n\nSimilarly, .GraphicsBuffer is the class that represents a hidden, offscreen buffer for rendering special offscreen effects, such as render-to-texture. It is common for an application to have many offscreen buffers open at once.\n\nBoth classes inherit from the base class .GraphicsOutput, which contains all of the code common to rendering to a window or offscreen buffer.\n\nGraphicsStateGuardian",
