  "content": "Panda's built-in Normal Mapping Capabilities\n\nNormally, to use fancy rendering techniques like normal mapping, you would have to write special GPU code called \"shaders.\" However, in Panda3D version 1.5.0, panda gained the ability to synthesize many shaders for you. What that means is that you can use many modern rendering techniques (including normal mapping) without having to know shader programming at all.\n\nLook in the models subdirectory for a model called \"abstractroom\". It was created in Maya, and a normal map was applied in Maya. The maya exporter was used to convert this into panda's model file format, abstractroom.egg. During the conversion process, the maya exporter noticed the normal map and included information about it in the egg file: if you examine the egg file with a text editor, you will see the references in there. You can view the model using panda's model viewer:\n\npview abstractroom.egg",
