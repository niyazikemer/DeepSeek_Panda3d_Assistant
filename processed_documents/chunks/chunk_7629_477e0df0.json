  "content": "Limiting graphics memory usage overall\n\nFinally, it may be prudent to limit the amount of graphics memory that Panda attempts to use, with a line like:\n\ngraphics-memory-limit 67108864``\n\nThe above example imposes a limit of 64MB (64 * 1024 * 1024) on the graphics memory that Panda will attempt to use. This can be a good idea to avoid allocating runaway textures on integrated graphics cards with no fixed texture limit, or to work around buggy graphics drivers that crash when you use too much. Panda will automatically start to unload textures when the specified limit is exceeded, even if the graphics driver would allow allocating more.",
