  "content": "Event Handlers\n\ncpp\n\nNote\n\nThis page has not yet been updated to cover the C++ event API.\n\nEvents occur either when the user does something (such as clicking a mouse <mouse-support> or pressing a key <keyboard-support>) or when sent by the script using messenger.send() <direct.showbase.Messenger.Messenger.send>. When an event occurs, Panda's \"messenger\" will check to see if you have written an \"event handler\" routine. If so, your event handler will be called. The messenger system is object-oriented, to create an event handler, you have to first create a class that inherits from DirectObject. Your event handler will be a method of your class.\n\nDefining a class that can Handle Events\n\nThe first step is to import the ~direct.showbase.DirectObject module:\n\nfrom direct.showbase import DirectObject\n\nWith DirectObject loaded, it is possible to create a subclass of DirectObject. This allows the class to inherit the messaging API and thus listen for events.",
