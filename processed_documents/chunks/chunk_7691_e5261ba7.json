  "content": "All of the above can be written as a single statement:\n\nactor = Actor('hero.egg', {\n    'walk': 'hero-walk.egg',\n    'swim': 'hero-swim.egg',\n})\n\nNote that it is also possible to store the animations and model in the same file. This is preferred in some other model formats, such as glTF. In that case, just create the Actor with just the model as parameter, without specifying a separate dictionary for the animations.\n\nWhen you wish to remove the actor from the scene, you need to call the ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.cleanup() method. Note that calling ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.removeNode() is not sufficient. This is due to the fact that Actor is a Python class containing additional data that can not be destroyed by the C++ ~.NodePath.remove_node() method.\n\nNote",
