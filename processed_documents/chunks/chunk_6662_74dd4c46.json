  "content": "Note that, although the image is stored as four separate images on disk, internally Panda3D stores it as a single, three-dimensional image, with height, width, and depth.\n\nThe Panda3D convention for naming the slices of a 3-D texture is fairly rigid. Each slice must be numbered, and all of the filenames must be the same except for the number; and the first (bottom) slice must be numbered 0. If you have followed this convention, then you can load a 3-D texture with a call like this:\n\ntex = loader.load3DTexture(\"grid_#.png\")",
