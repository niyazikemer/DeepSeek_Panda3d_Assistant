  "content": "3-D Textures\n\nSo far, we have only talked about ordinary 2-D texture maps. Panda3D also supports the concept of a 3-D texture map. This is a volumetric texture: in addition to a height and a width, it also has a depth:\n\nThe 3-D texture image is solid all the way through; if we were to cut away part of the cube we would discover that the checkerboard pattern continues within:\n\nThis is true no matter what shape we carve out of the cube:\n\nIn addition to the usual u and v texture dimensions, a 3-D texture also has w. In order to apply a 3-D texture to geometry, you will therefore need to have 3-D texture coordinates (u, v, w) on your geometry, instead of just the ordinary (u, v).",
