  "content": "Converting from Autodesk Maya\n\nThis section talks about how to prepare a Maya model for export, and then export it. Since exporting is the very last step, the actual instructions for the export process are last.\n\nMaterial Preparation\n\nBasic Texturing\n\nIn order for the Panda3D to correctly export your textures, you must texture your model in a manner that Panda3D understands. In fact, you have to follow a fairly strict formula in order for Panda3D to be able to make sense of your scene.\n\nTeaching how to use Maya is beyond the scope of this manual. We assume that you already know how to use maya, and especially the hypershade. The only purpose of this section is to show you what configurations are understood by Panda3D.\n\nThe first step in texturing your model is to apply a \"Phong\" shader. This is the only kind of shader that Panda3D understands. You can apply a phong shader using the Maya menus:",
