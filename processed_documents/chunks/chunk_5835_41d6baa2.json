When the animation is played, Panda accumulates the transforms for each joint.\n\nAlthough joints are defined using a local transform, vertices are defined in an egg file using global coordinates, which is irrespective of transforms appearing within the egg file. This means when Panda loads the egg file is loaded, the vertex coordinates given in the egg file must be pre-transformed by the appropriate inverse matrix to compensate.\n\nCustom .egg Readers/Writers\n\nWhen writing an importer or exporter for panda, you have two choices.",
