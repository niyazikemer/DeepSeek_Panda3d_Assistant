  "content": "Bullet Vehicles\n\nBullet comes with a simple vehicle controller, which can be used for arcade style vehicle simulations. Instead of simulation of each wheel and chassis as separate rigid bodies connected by joints, it simply uses a single rigid body for the chassis. Collision detection for the wheels is approximated by ray casts, and the tire friction is a basic anisotropic friction model. This approach to vehicle modelling is called \"raycast vehicle\", and it is used widely in commercial and non-commercial driving games.\n\nSetup\n\nIn order to create a vehicle we first have to create an ordinary dynamic rigid body. This rigid body will serve as the vehicle chassis. Then we can create a new instance of .BulletVehicle. We have to pass the .BulletWorld and the .BulletRigidBodyNode as arguments to the vehicle constructor.\n\npython\n\nThe following code snippet shows how this could be done.\n\nfrom panda3d.bullet import BulletVehicle",
