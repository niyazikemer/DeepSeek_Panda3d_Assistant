  "content": "Compute shaders are only available on hardware supporting OpenGL 4.3, which includes NVIDIA GeForce 400 series and above and AMD Radeon HD 5000 series and above.\n\nIt is important to know that compute shaders are an advanced, low-level, and relatively recent feature. This means that it is very easy to get strange and unexplainable results, including garbled texture data, or even video card crashes and system freezes in some cases. Using them certainly requires a certain amount of expertise with graphics programming. In many cases, similar results can be achieved with render-to-texture processes.\n\nThis page only aims to give a cursory overview of compute shaders where it is relevant to Panda3D's interfaces. It is by no means a comprehensive manual covering everything about compute shaders. In particular, image access concurrency, shared or coherent variables, and memory barriers are not covered here at all. Please refer to the OpenGL documentation for more information.\n\nWork groups",
