  "content": "Mainly useful for debugging when the process goes wrong. keep-texture-ram bool 0 Set this to true to retain the ram image for each texture after it\nhas been prepared with the GSG. This will allow the texture to be\nprepared with multiple GSG's, or to be re-prepared later after it is\nexplicitly released from the GSG, without having to reread the texture\nimage from disk; but it will consume memory somewhat wastefully. lens-far-limit double 1e-7 This number is used to reduce the effect of numeric inaccuracies in\nLens::extrude(). It should be a very small, positive number, almost\nzero; set it larger if Lens::extrude() returns values that appear\nmeaningless, and set it smaller if you appear to be unable to move the\nfar plane out far enough. lens-geom-segments int 50 This is the number of times to subdivide the visualization wireframe\ncreated when Lens::make_geometry() (or LensNode::show_frustum()) is\ncalled, for representing accurate curves.
