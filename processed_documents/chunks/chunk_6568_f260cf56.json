  "content": "DirectScrollBar has many things in common with directslider. Like directslider, the normal DirectGui parameters such as frameSize, geom, and relief control the look of the trough. You can control the look of the thumb by prefixing each of these parameters with the prefix \"thumb_\", e.g. thumb_frameSize; similarly, you can control the look of the two scroll buttons by prefixing these with \"incButton_\" and \"decButton_\". You can retrieve or set the current position of the thumb with myScrollBar['value'].",
