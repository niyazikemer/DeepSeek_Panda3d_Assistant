This function calls one of NodePath's flattening functions every time the terrain is regenerated, and each time before the chunks are modified the terrain is restored from a backup node:\n\npython\n\nterrain.setAutoFlatten(GeoMipTerrain.AFMStrong)\n\ncpp\n\nterrain.set_auto_flatten(GeoMipTerrain::AFM_strong);",
