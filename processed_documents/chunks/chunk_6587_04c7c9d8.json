  "content": "Alternative Render Modes\n\nFonts loaded through the FreeType library (resulting in a DynamicTextFont object) are normally rasterized into textures and mapped onto polygons, due to the default Render Mode being set to RM_texture. The render mode however can be changed using the method ~.DynamicTextFont.set_render_mode(), to allow for radically different generated characters. For example, the following statement ensures that generated characters will be fully three-dimensional, thick, polygonal characters.\n\npython\n\nfont.setRenderMode(TextFont.RMSolid)\n\ncpp\n\ndfont->set_render_mode(TexFont::RM_solid);\n\npython\n\nOther available modes are TextFont.RMWireframe, generating characters as polylines, TextFont.RMPolygon, generating characters as flat polygonal objects, and TextFont.RMExtruded, generating characters as extruded polygonal surfaces.\n\ncpp",
