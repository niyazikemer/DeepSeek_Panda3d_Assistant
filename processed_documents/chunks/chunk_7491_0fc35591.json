It is also designed for zero runtime overhead when it is compiled out.\n\nThere is one global .PStatClient class object, which manages all of the communications on the client side. Each PStatCollector is simply an index into an array stored within the PStatClient object, although the interface is intended to hide this detail from the programmer.\n\nInitially, before the PStatClient has established a connection, calls to start() and stop() simply return immediately.",
