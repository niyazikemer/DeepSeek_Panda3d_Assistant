This includes mipmaps, and accounts for texture\n        # compression.  Visually, a texture with mipmaps will be\n        # represented by a rectangle 33% larger than an\n        # equivalent-sized texture without mipmaps.  Of course, this\n        # once again has little bearing to the way the textures are\n        # actually arranged in memory; but it serves to give a visual\n        # indication of how much texture memory each texture consumes.",
