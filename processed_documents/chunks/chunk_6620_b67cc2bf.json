  "content": "Bullet Softbodies\n\nSoft bodies are similar to rigid bodies, just they are not rigid but soft. This means that the shape of a soft body can change - they are deformable. Bullet is capable of simulating soft body deformation in real-time. This is not to be confused with playback of animation. Animation are computed up in front, usually not in real-time, and then saved to a file.\n\nBullet simulates soft bodies internally by making up a complex compound objects, consisting of nodes and links. The nodes can be best compared to the vertices of a mesh used to render 3D geometry. The links can be visualized as springs in between the nodes; just that this kind of spring not only responds to compression, but also to bending.\n\nDepending on how the nodes and links are arranged it is possible to create three different kinds of soft bodies:",
