  "content": "Next look at the colors defined in the egg file. If you compare all the color entries, you will only find eight unique colors in the egg file. Why does the model have thousands of colors when viewed in the model viewer then? This is because of linear interpolation, where a value is generated between two different values based on a \"distance\". Today graphic cards are very good at linear interpolation with the ability to do billions of linear interpolations per second. The downside is that sometimes the graphic card can ONLY do linear interpolation and you can't change that, even with a shader.",
