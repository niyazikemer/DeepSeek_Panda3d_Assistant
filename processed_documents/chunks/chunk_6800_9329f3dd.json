This prevents\nthe accidental generation of large vertex buffers from lots of smaller\nvertex buffers, while not imposing a limit on the original size of any\none GeomVertexData structure. max-color-targets int -1 Set this to a positive integer to limit the number of color targets\nreported by the GSG. This can be used to limit the amount of render\ntargets Panda will attempt to use. If this is zero or less, the GSG will\nreport its honest number of color targets, allowing Panda the full use\nof the graphics card; if it is 1 or more, then Panda will never allow\nmore than this number of color targets simultaneously, regardless of\nwhat the GSG says it can do. max-compressed-vertex-data int 0 Specifies the maximum number of bytes of all vertex data that is",
