Newly created objects usually are drawn on top of already existing ones, unless you change it manually.\n\nAdditionally you can position the frame using setPos(). This works with other aspects like scale as well.\n\nThe example above would change as follows:\n\nfrom direct.gui.DirectGui import DirectFrame",
