There's no requirement for these two NodePaths to be related in any way.\n\nLots of Lights: Performance Implications\n\nEach light slows down rendering a little. Using a half-dozen lights to illuminate an object is no problem at all. However, if you were to use a hundred lights to illuminate an object, that object would render slowly.",
