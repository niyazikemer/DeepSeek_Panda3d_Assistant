  "content": "Physics\n\nWhile collision-detection addresses the problem of preventing objects from intersecting each other adequately for most applications, some games and simulations may need to model more realistic dynamic interactions between objects, taking into account such things as an object's mass, friction, elasticity and external forces.\n\nThese uses may require the use of a physics engine. This is a system that can model interactions between objects using physics equations, taking into account far more parameters than a simple collision response system can.\n\nPanda3D offers several choices to use for physics. Before you choose one, however, think carefully whether you need the additional complexity, performance and authoring cost of a physics simulation, and whether perhaps collision-detection on its own might be adequate for your use-cases.",
