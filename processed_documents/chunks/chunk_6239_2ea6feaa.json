  "content": "Panda3D also provides a number of utilities that make it convenient to use render-to-texture for certain specific applications. For example, there is a utility that helps set up common image filters. There is another that helps set up cube-map environment maps. The downside of these utilities is that each one performs a fairly specific function, and if there isn't one for your particular application, you'll need to resort to the lower-level API.\n\nIn the following sections, we document the high-level utilities first, because these are what most people are going to use. If none of the utilities does what you need, then the last subsection explains the low-level API.\n\ncommon-image-filters generalized-image-filters dynamic-cube-maps low-level-render-to-texture",
