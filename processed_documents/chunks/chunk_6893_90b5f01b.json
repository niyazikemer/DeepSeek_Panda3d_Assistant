  "content": "Per-Pixel Lighting\n\nSimply turning on ~.NodePath.set_shader_auto() causes one immediate change: all lighting calculations are done per-pixel instead of per-vertex. This means that models do not have to be highly tessellated in order to get nice-looking spotlights or specular highlights.\n\nOf course, the real magic of ~.NodePath.set_shader_auto() is that it enables you to use powerful features like normal maps and the like.\n\nHardware Skinning\n\nThe shader generator is additionally able to improve performance of vertex animation by performing the vertex transformation in the shader, so that it does not need to happen on the CPU. There are some limitations on this feature, so it is disabled by default. To enable it, you will need to set the following variables in the Config.prc <configuring-panda3d> file:\n\nhardware-animated-vertices true\nbasic-shaders-only false",
