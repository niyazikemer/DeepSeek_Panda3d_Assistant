This means two\n    IndirectIntervals that operate on the same nested interval may\n    have some interaction that you should be aware of.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Interval counter\n    indirectIntervalNum = 1\n\n    notify = directNotify.newCategory('IndirectInterval')\n\n    # Class methods\n    def __init__(self, interval,\n                 startT = 0, endT = None, playRate = 1,\n                 duration = None, blendType = 'noBlend', name = None):\n        self.interval = interval\n\n        self.startAtStart = (startT == 0)\n        self.endAtEnd = (endT is None or endT == interval.getDuration())",
