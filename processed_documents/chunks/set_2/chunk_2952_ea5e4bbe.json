This represents the intended limit to texture\n        # memory utilization.  We (generously) assume that the\n        # graphics card will implement a perfect texture packing\n        # algorithm, so that as long as our total utilization <=\n        # self.limit, it must fit within texture memory.  We represent\n        # this visually by aggressively packing textures within the\n        # self.limit block so that they are guaranteed to fit, as long\n        # as we do not exceed the total utilization.  This may\n        # sometimes mean distorting a texture block or even breaking\n        # it into multiple pieces to get it to fit, clearly\n        # fictionalizing whatever the graphics driver is actually\n        # doing.",
