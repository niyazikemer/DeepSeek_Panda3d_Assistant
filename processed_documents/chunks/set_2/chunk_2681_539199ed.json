Two of\n    the states should be oposites of each other and the other\n    two should be the transition states between the first two.\n    E.g::\n\n                    +--------+\n                 -->| closed | --\n                |   +--------+   |\n                |                |\n                |                v\n          +---------+       +---------+\n          | closing |<----->| opening |\n          +---------+       +---------+\n                ^                |\n                |                |\n                |    +------+    |\n                 ----| open |<---\n                     +------+\n\n    There is a fifth off state, but that is an implementation\n    detail (and that's why it's not called a five state ClassicFSM).",
