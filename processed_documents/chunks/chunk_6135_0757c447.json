Doing this has a couple of advantages compared to enabling multisample filtering on the main window, such as the fact that you can switch this setting based on detected capabilities and user settings, without having to reopen the window.\n\nWhen using this setting, it is recommended to leave multisample filtering off on the main window, otherwise it will be a waste of GPU memory. So, do not put framebuffer-multisample in your Config.prc file.\n\nThis filter is available as of Panda3D 1.10.13.",
