  "content": "The method .NodePath.set_shader_input() stores data that can be accessed by the shader. It is possible to store data of type .Texture, .NodePath, and any vector object.\n\nThe data that you store using ~.NodePath.set_shader_input() isn't necessarily used by the shader. Instead, the values are stored in the node, but unless the shader explicitly asks for them, they will sit unused. So the example above simply stores the vector, but it is up to the shader whether or not it is interested in a data item labeled \"tint\".\n\nTo fetch data that was supplied using ~.NodePath.set_shader_input(), the shader must use the appropriate parameter name. See the list of GLSL shader inputs <list-of-glsl-shader-inputs> or the list of Cg shader inputs <list-of-possible-cg-shader-inputs>, many of which refer to the data that was stored using ~.NodePath.set_shader_input().",
