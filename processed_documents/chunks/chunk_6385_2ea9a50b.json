  "content": "The Window Framework\n\npython\n\nThe WindowFramework class is for use in C++ only. If you use Python, you can just use ShowBase to open a window and skip this page.\n\ncpp\n\nThis page will explain how to use the WindowFramework class in C++ to open a blank window. First of all, we need to include the appropriate header files:\n\n#include \"pandaFramework.h\"\n#include \"pandaSystem.h\"\n\nSecond, we need to create an instance of the PandaFramework class, and use it to open a window.\n\nPandaFramework framework;\nframework.open_framework(argc, argv);\nframework.set_window_title(\"Hello World!\");\n\nWindowFramework *window = framework.open_window();\n\nOptionally, we can enable keyboard support, in case we want to check for keyboard presses, and we can enable the default camera trackball. Note that you also need to enable keyboard support to receive mouse button events, since it sets up the button event handlers.",
