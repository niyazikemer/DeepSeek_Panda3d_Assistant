  "content": "Introduction to Panda3D\n\nPanda3D Basics\n\nPanda3D is a 3D engine: a library of subroutines for 3D rendering and game development. The library is C++ with a set of Python bindings. Game development with Panda3D usually consists of writing a Python or C++ program that controls the Panda3D library.\n\nPanda3D was created for commercial game development and is still used for developing commercial games. Because of this, the engine needs to emphasize four areas: power, speed, completeness, and error tolerance. Everyone knows what power and speed are. But completeness and error tolerance deserve some extra commentary.\n\nCompleteness means that Panda3D contains many unexciting but essential tools: scene graph browsing, performance monitoring, animation optimizers, and so forth.",
