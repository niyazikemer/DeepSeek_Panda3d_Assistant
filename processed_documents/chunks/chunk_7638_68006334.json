To enable this debugging mode, set the boolean variable \"show-buffers #t\" in your panda configuration file.\n\nThe Advanced API\n\nThe simple API is convenient, but there are a few things it can not do. For instance, it can not:\n\nCopy the main window into a texture.\n\nCopy the Z-buffer into a depth texture.\n\nCopy the window into a texture, but not every frame.\n\nLimit or force the use of Parasite buffers.\n\nIf you need this level of control, you need to use a lower-level API. The low-level function that is called for the creation of all buffers and windows is ~.GraphicsEngine.make_output() on the .GraphicsEngine class.\n\npython\n\n# Request 8 RGB bits, no alpha bits, and a depth buffer.\nfb_prop = FrameBufferProperties()\nfb_prop.setRgbColor(True)\nfb_prop.setRgbaBits(8, 8, 8, 0)\nfb_prop.setDepthBits(16)",
