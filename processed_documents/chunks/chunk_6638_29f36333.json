  "content": "You will need to create a .WindowProperties object as well. At a minimum, this defines the X, Y size of the window or buffer you want to create. For an offscreen buffer, this is all it defines; but if you are creating a window, it also allows you to specify things like the window title, the placement onscreen, whether it should be user-resizable, and so on. You can get a default WindowProperties object using .WindowProperties.get_default(). The default WindowProperties object has its settings filled in according to Config.prc file variables. If you are creating an offscreen buffer, you may wish to use WindowProperties(size=(W, H)) which creates a simple WindowProperties object that simply requests a buffer of size W\u00d7H.",
