  "content": "Materials\n\nMaterials\n\nMaterials affect how the surfaces of models appear when lights are enabled in Panda. These have various effects such as how shiny an object appears, the brightness of its colors etc. Material properties are combined with textures and lighting to get the final look of an object.\n\nIt must be emphasized that materials only work when lights are applied to an object. Otherwise, materials have no effect.\n\nExplanation of Lighting\n\nWhen light strikes a 3D model, light reflects off the model. If there were no light reflecting off the model, the model would appear pitch black. The light reflecting off the model is what causes it to have a non-black color onscreen. In the real world, light is incredibly complicated --- so complicated, that it is infeasible to do realistic calculations. Instead, Panda3D leaves it in your hands, giving you some basic tools to express how much light you want reflecting from each surface.",
