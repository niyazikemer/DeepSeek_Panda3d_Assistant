Since there is not as much detail parallel to the\n    grain as across it, the texture does not need to be as large in\n    the Z dimension as in the other two dimensions.\n\n    The woodgrain shape is perturbed with Perlin noise to make it more\n    organic.  The parameters noiseScale and noiseZScale controls the\n    frequency of the noise; larger numbers make smoother rings.  The\n    parameter noiseAmp controls the effect of the noise; larger\n    numbers make more dramatic distortions.\n\n    ringScale controls the number of rings visible in the cross\n    section of the texture.  A larger number makes more, denser rings.\n    \"\"\"",
