  "content": "GeomPoints\n\nThis is the simplest kind of GeomPrimitive; it stores a number of individual points. Each point has exactly one vertex.\n\nBy default, each point is rendered as one pixel. You can use nodePath.set_render_mode_thickness() <.NodePath.set_render_mode_thickness> to change this; if you specify a thickness greater than 1, this will make the points render as squares (which always face the camera), where the vertex coordinate is the center point of the square, and the square has the specified number of pixels along each side. Each point will always be the same width in pixels, no matter how far it is from the camera. Unlike line segments, thick points are supported by DirectX.",
