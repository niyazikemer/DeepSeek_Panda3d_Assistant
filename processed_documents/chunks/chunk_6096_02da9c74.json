  "content": "Distributed Class Definition\n\nThe .dc file defines what distributed objects, and their functions, are communicated across the network.\n\nA direct.dc file is shipped with the engine and placed in the direct/distributed/ path, which defines the necessary functionality for the distributed objects bundled with Panda3D. You may want to copy this file to a more convenient location related to your game to simplify the loading with the lists used in the repositories shown before.\n\nThe syntax is a mix of C++ and python.\n\nA simple example of such a dc file may look as follows.\n\nimport DGameObject/AI\nimport AIDGameObject/AI\n\nstruct gameDataModel {\n  string value_a;\n  uint8 value_b;\n  int8 value_c/100;\n}\n\ndclass DGameObject: DistributedObject {\n  sendGameData(gameDataModel data) p2p;\n};\n\ndclass AIDGameObject: DistributedObject {\n  setAnounceGenerate(string helloMsg) broadcast ram;\n  messageRoundtripToAI(gameDataModel data) p2p;\n  messageRoundtripToClient(gameDataModel data) p2p;\n}\n\nKeywords",
