This is important in order to layer text on top of the 3-D scene, of course.\n\nThe second group of commands creates a camera with an OrthographicLens. The lens is created with a wide near/far clipping plane: -1000 to 1000. This probably doesn't matter too much since we expect that everything we parent to this scene graph will have a Y value of 0 (which is easily between -1000 and 1000), but this allows us to accept a wide range of Y values.",
