  "content": "suspect that this is causing problems or if you simply don't need the\nfunctionality. gl-debug bool 0 Setting this to true will cause OpenGL to emit more useful error and\ndebug messages, at a slight runtime performance cost. notify-level-glgsg\ncontrols which severity levels are shown. gl-debug-abort-level enum fatal Set this to a setting other than 'fatal' to cause an abort to be\ntriggered when an error of the indicated severity level (or a more\nsevere one) occurs. This is useful if you want to attach a debugger. If\nyou set this, it is highly recommended to also set gl-debug-synchronous,\nsince the call stack will otherwise not point to the GL call that\ntriggered the error message. This feature is not available when NDEBUG\nhas been defined. gl-debug-buffers bool 0 Set this true, in addition to enabling debug notify for glgsg, to\nenable debug messages about the creation and destruction of OpenGL",
