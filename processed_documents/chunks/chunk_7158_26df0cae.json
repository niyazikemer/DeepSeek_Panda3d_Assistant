  "content": "Clearing Display Regions\n\nWhen you have more than one DisplayRegion in a particular window, it is important to consider which of them, if any, you want to perform an explicit clear operation before drawing.\n\nClearing means to erase the contents of the window or DisplayRegion, and set it all to the background color. Normally, you should perform a clear at the beginning of every frame, or you will be drawing the new frame on top of the contents of the previous frame.\n\nThe default is for clear to be performed by the GraphicsOutput (the window or buffer), before any DisplayRegions are drawn at all. This is usually the best way to clear the window, because it is slightly faster to perform one big clear operation that resets the whole window at once, rather than clearing each DisplayRegion individually. This particularly makes sense when your DisplayRegions don't overlap, and they all want to have the same background color, like this:",
