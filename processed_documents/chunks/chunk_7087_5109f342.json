  "content": "Finding Performance Issues\n\nIt is not a good idea to immediately start optimizing various parts of a slow application without first understanding what is causing the slowdown. Performance optimization is not a matter of \"every little bit helps\". You may spend a lot of time reducing the run time of a function you think is slow, when it turns out that it is taking only a few microseconds, and has a negligible effect on your frame rate. Or, you may optimize a function that does take a long time, only to find out that it doesn't help at all because the engine had to wait for some unrelated process to finish anyway.",
