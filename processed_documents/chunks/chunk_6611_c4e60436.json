  "content": "If separating the phases onto different threads were all that we did, we wouldn't have accomplished anything useful, because each phase must still wait for the previous phase to complete before it can proceed. It's impossible to run Cull to figure out what things are going to be rendered before the App phase has finished arranging the scene graph properly. Similarly, it's impossible to run Draw until the Cull phase has finished processing the scene graph and constructing the list of objects.\n\nHowever, once App has finished processing frame 1, there's no reason for that thread to sit around waiting for the rest of the frame to be finished drawing. It can go right ahead and start working on frame 2, at the same time that the Cull thread starts processing frame 1. And then by the time Cull has finished processing frame 1, it can start working on culling frame 2 (which App has also just finished with). Putting it all in graphical form, the frame time now looks like this:",
