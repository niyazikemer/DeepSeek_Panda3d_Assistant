In order to get this right, it is important to be aware of all the different coordinate spaces that panda uses. You must know what \"space\" the coordinate is in. Here is a list of the major coordinate spaces:\n\nIn OpenGL, \"clip space\" and \"API clip space\" are equivalent.\n\nSupplying Translation Matrices to a Shader",
