  "content": "Also see issue #993.\n\nIn order for multisample antialiasing to work, you have to have multisample bits available in your framebuffer. To request this, add:\n\nframebuffer-multisample 1\nmultisamples 2\n\nto your Config.prc file. Note that not all graphics cards have this capability. You may also be able to request more multisamples, such as 4 or 8, depending on your graphics card. If your card can provide additional samples, it produces a higher-quality antialiasing, at a small cost to render time.\n\nNote\n\nOn some graphics cards, enabling a multisample framebuffer will automatically enable multisample antialiasing, regardless of the setting of the antialias attribute. It is not possible to disable this. If you do not want the entire framebuffer to be multisample-antialiased, consider the use of render-to-texture.",
