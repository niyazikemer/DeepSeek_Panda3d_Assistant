  "content": "In a double-threshold system, the brightness of the diffuse lighting contribution is compared to the thresholds t0 and t1. If neither is attained, the diffuse light contribution is eliminated. If it is met, the pixel's brightness is normalized to either l0 or l1, depending on which threshold was passed.\n\nFuture Light Ramps\n\nWe are interested in knowing if there are any other light ramps you would like to see. If so, please notify us on the forums.",
