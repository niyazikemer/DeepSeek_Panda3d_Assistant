  "content": "Caveats\n\nAt the present, the CollisionTraverser only uses the previous transform information when the \"from\" object is a CollisionSphere. Other kinds of collision solids currently do not consider the previous transform.\n\nEnabling the previous transform mode helps reduce slipping through walls considerably. However, it's not perfect; no collision system is. If your object is moving tremendously fast, or just happens to get lucky and slip through a tiny crack between adjacent polygons, it may still get through without detecting a collision. Any good application will be engineered so that the occasional collision slip does not cause any real harm.",
