  "content": "The above methods apply a 2-d transform to your texture coordinates, which is appropriate, since texture coordinates are usually two-dimensional. However, sometimes you are working with 3-d texture coordinates <3d-textures>, and you really do want to apply a 3-d transform. For those cases, there are the following methods:\n\nnodePath.setTexPos(TextureStage, uOffset, vOffset, wOffset)\nnodePath.setTexScale(TextureStage, uScale, vScale, wScale)\nnodePath.setTexHpr(TextureStage, h, p, r)\n\nAnd there is also one generic form:\n\nnodePath.setTexTransform(TextureStage, transform);",
