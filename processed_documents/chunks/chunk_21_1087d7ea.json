You install a new piece of software. Adding software gives a computer new capabilities. If you could download new software to your video card, they reasoned, you wouldn't need design a new video card every time you thought of a new rendering trick. You could upgrade the new feature right into the card, right when you needed it.\n\nAnd so, shaders were invented. Shaders are software for video cards. Shaders look just like computer programs, but they're executed by the video card, not the computer. If a video card supports shaders, it can be upgraded to support almost any desired behavior. Pretty much, the only thing that limits a shader-based video card is its speed.\n\nAutomatic use of Shaders",
