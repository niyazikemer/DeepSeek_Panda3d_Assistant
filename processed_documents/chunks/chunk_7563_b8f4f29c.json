  "content": "Cube Maps\n\nThere is one more special kind of texture map: the cube map. A cube map is similar to a 3-D texture <3d-textures>, in that it requires 3-D texture coordinates (u, v, w); also, a cube map is stored on disk as a sequence of ordinary 2-D images.\n\nBut unlike a 3-D texture, which is defined by stacking up an arbitrary number of 2-D images like pancakes to fill up a volume, a cube map is always defined with exactly six 2-D images, which are folded together to make a cube.\n\nThe six images of a cube map are numbered from 0 to 5, and each image corresponds to one particular face of the cube:\n\nimage 0 The +u (or +x ) face (right) image 1 The -u (or -x ) face (left) image 2 The +v (or +y ) face (forward) image 3 The -v (or -y ) face (back) image 4 The +w (or +z ) face (up) image 5 The -w (or -z ) face (down)",
