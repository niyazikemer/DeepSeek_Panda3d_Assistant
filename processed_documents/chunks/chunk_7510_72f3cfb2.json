  "content": "Method Explanation .ColorAttrib.make_vertex() Used by the model loader to indicate that the model has vertex\ncolors stored in its vertex arrays. .ColorAttrib.make_flat() Used by the model loader to indicate that the model has a single\nflat color. .ColorAttrib.make_off() Used by the model loader to indicate that no particular color was\nspecified. Essentially the same as flat white, but possibly a little\nfaster to render.\n\nPanda combines these color attributes with the textures. If you are accustomed to Photoshop, you should think of the model's color as the bottom (background) layer, and the textures go above that. By default, each texture is modulated (multiplied) with the previous layer, but as in Photoshop, that can be changed.\n\nRecoloring the Model\n\nIf you wish, you can manually override the color attribute which has been specified by the model loader.\n\npython\n\nnodePath.setColor(r, g, b, a)\n\ncpp\n\nnodePath.set_color(r, g, b, a);",
