We can create a new wheel using the createWheel factory method of the previously created vehicle. Once created we still have to configure the wheel, that is set friction parameters, offset of the wheel hub with respect to the chassis, axle direction and so on.\n\npython\n\nThe following sample shows how to create and configure a wheel. In this case a front wheel is created. Front wheels are steerable.\n\nwheelNP = loader.loadModel('path/to/model')\nwheelNP.reparentTo(render)\n\nwheel = vehicle.createWheel()\n\nwheel.setNode(wheelNP.node())\nwheel.setChassisConnectionPointCs(Point3(0.8, 1.1, 0.3))\nwheel.setFrontWheel(True)\n\nwheel.setWheelDirectionCs(Vec3(0, 0, -1))\nwheel.setWheelAxleCs(Vec3(1, 0, 0))\nwheel.setWheelRadius(0.25)\nwheel.setMaxSuspensionTravelCm(40.0)",
