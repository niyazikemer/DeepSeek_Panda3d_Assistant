  "content": "TXO files have the same drawbacks as BAM files: they are tied to a particular version of Panda, so you may need to regenerate them when you next upgrade your Panda version.\n\nA bigger drawback to storing pre-compressed texture images this way is that not all graphics cards support all kinds of DXT compression, and if you try to load a TXO file that a graphics card doesn't understand, Panda3D will decompress the texture on the CPU before uploading it to the graphics card. Thus, pre-compressing all of your textures may cause a loss of texture quality on older cards.\n\nNote that decompression is only available if Panda3D has been compiled with support for the libsquish library; if not, the texture will fail to load entirely if the driver does not support the requested compression mode.\n\nDDS file format",
