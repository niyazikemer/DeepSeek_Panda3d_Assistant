When you call a function in Python, Python calls the C++ equivalent, same for classes. For example, when you load a model, Panda3D's C++ side does all the job of reading from the 3d file, creating the vertices, faces, applying the materials, textures and so on. The Python overhead is usually very small. Many other games and game engines use scripting languages for writing the game logic code, because usually the difference in performance time is negligible and scripting languages clearly win when it comes to development time.",
