  "content": "simple image should approximate the original image. The smaller the\nnumber, the closer the match; small numbers will result in simple images\nclose to the maximum size specified by simple-image-size. Larger numbers\nwill result in smaller simple images. Generally the value should be\nconsiderably less than 1. singular-points bool 1 Set this true to insist that when RenderModeAttrib::M_points is\nused, each point appears only once in the result, even if the vertex is\nreferenced multiple times. This is particularly important when rendering\npoints from a triangle mesh and you don't want the points to appear\nrepeatedly. sleep-precision double 0.01 This is the accuracy within which we can expect select() to return\nprecisely. That is, if we use select() to request a timeout of 1.0\nseconds, we can expect to actually sleep for somewhere between 1.0 and\n1.0 + sleep-precision seconds. ssl-certificates list This variable lists additional filenames, on top of the file named",
