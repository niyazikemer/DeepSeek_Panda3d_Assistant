  "content": "This is a variant of aspect2d that is scaled up such that one Panda unit is equal to one pixel on screen. It can be used if pixel-perfect layout of UI elements is desired. Its pixel origin is also in the top-left corner of the screen. Because Panda uses a Z-up coordinate system, however, please note that the Z direction goes up the screen rather than down, and therefore it is necessary to use negative instead of positive coordinates in the Z direction.\n\nThis is a scene graph that is not used for anything, to which nodes can be parented that should not appear anywhere. This is esoteric and rarely needs to be used; the use of ~panda3d.core.NodePath.stash() will suffice in most situations wherein a node needs to be temporarily removed from the scene graph.",
