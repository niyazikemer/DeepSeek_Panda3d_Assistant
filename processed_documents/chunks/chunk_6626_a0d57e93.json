  "content": "Sample Programs: Fireflies\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nA nature scene with 500 fireflies: how do you do a high-polygon scene with 500 lights, without a total performance collapse?\n\nThis sample program shows how to do Deferred Shading in Panda. You can have hundreds of lights, and all the lights affect all the models automatically. This is not expensive: the cost is only proportional to the number of actual lit pixels times the number of times each pixel is lit. That's why fireflies make a perfect demonstration --- you could never have 500 lights in a high-polygon scene without deferred shading. But perhaps even more important is the elegance of a rendering algorithm that automatically connects lights to the appropriate objects without the need for LightAttribs.",
