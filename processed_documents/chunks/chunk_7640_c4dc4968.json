In the case of an offscreen buffer, which is acquired by passing BF_refuse_window as a flag, only the size setting of the WindowProperties object is used.\n\nOffscreen buffers may require passing in a host window and a host GSG, since the graphics API may require an existing graphics context in order to create an offscreen buffer. When creating a window, the last two parameters may be omitted.\n\nFor the meaning of the various flags, consult the GraphicsPipe API documentation.",
