  "content": "Ideally, it would be great to query the amount of useful graphics memory provided by the card, and set this as the graphics-memory-limit; unfortunately, this is impractical for several reasons, including the reasons given above. Typically, if you wish your application to work on a variety of hardware, you will need to come up with a handful of default settings and allow the user to select between them, according to his own knowledge of his hardware capabilities.\n\nMonitoring memory usage\n\nYou can see how much graphics memory you are actually consuming with the PStats <measuring-performance-with-pstats> tool. Select the \"Graphics memory\" option. This graph will show the amount of memory required for active (onscreen), and inactive (offscreen) textures. It also includes memory required for vertex and index buffers, though these are typically much smaller than your texture memory requirements.",
