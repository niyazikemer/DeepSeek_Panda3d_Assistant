This allows access to the graphical display, the scene graph, the input devices, the task and event managers, and all the other things that ShowBase is responsible for setting up and managing.\n\nAlthough it is not a required component, most Panda3D applications are created using the ShowBase abstraction layer, because it sets up nearly everything needed by most games and simulations, with only a minimal amount of set up required. In fact, to start up a ShowBase application, it is only necessary to call:\n\nfrom direct.showbase.ShowBase import ShowBase\n\nbase = ShowBase()\nbase.run()\n\nThere can only be one ShowBase instance at a time; call ~direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.destroy() to get rid of it, which will allow another instance to be created.",
