The total fill-consumption of the scene is the total screen real estate of all objects, including the occluded ones. Particles, in particular, can consume fill-rate like crazy, especially if the camera gets close to the particles.\n\nmemory-full. A floating-point number takes four bytes. Just one vertex contains (X,Y,Z), and a normal, and a texture coordinate. An RGBA color takes four bytes, so a 1024x1024 texture is four megabytes. Do the math, and you'll see how fast it all adds up.",
