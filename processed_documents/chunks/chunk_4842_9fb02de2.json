  "content": "\"\"\" This module contains `.ShowBase`, an application framework responsible\nfor opening a graphical display, setting up input devices and creating\nthe scene graph.\n\nThe simplest way to open a ShowBase instance is to execute this code:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   from direct.showbase.ShowBase import ShowBase\n\n   base = ShowBase()\n   base.run()\n\nA common approach is to create your own subclass inheriting from ShowBase.\n\nBuilt-in global variables\n-------------------------\n\nSome key variables used in all Panda3D scripts are actually attributes of the\nShowBase instance.  When creating an instance of this class, it will write many\nof these variables to the built-in scope of the Python interpreter, so that\nthey are accessible to any Python module, without the need for extra imports.\nFor example, the ShowBase instance itself is accessible anywhere through the\n:data:`~builtins.base` variable.",
