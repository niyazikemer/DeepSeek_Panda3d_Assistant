This allows you to make the distinction between requesting a state directly, and feeding a particular input string to an FSM. To feed input to this FSM, you would use the request() call, just as before:\n\nmyfsm.request('left') # or myfsm.request_left()\nmyfsm.request('left')\nmyfsm.request('straight') # or myfsm.request_straight()\nmyfsm.request('left')\n\nIf the FSM had been in state North originally, after the above sequence of operations it would now be in state East.\n\nThe defaultFilter method",
