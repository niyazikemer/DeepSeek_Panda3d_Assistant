  "content": "Using memoryviews\n\nSince .GeomVertexArrayData supports the buffer protocol (as of Panda3D 1.9.0; see this blog post), an alternative to using GeomVertexWriter/Reader/Rewriter <more-about-geomvertexreader-geomvertexwriter-and-geomvertexrewriter> (as described in creating-and-filling-a-geomvertexdata) is to use memoryview objects to alter the contents of this structure directly. Other object types that implement the buffer protocol are bytearray and array.array in Python, as well as numpy arrays, so it's possible to seamlessly pass data between these and memoryviews.\n\nA memoryview can be used to change the values in a vertex array, but also to add values right after the creation of the array.\n\nCreating geometry",
