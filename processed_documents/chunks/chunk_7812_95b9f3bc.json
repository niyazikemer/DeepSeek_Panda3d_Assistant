  "content": "In Max, it is a little difficult to create a single bone, because the bone creation tool usually creates two. After clicking to create a bone, look in the object list, and you'll see \"Bone01\", \"Bone02\", which proves that there are indeed two. The easiest thing to do is to create the pair of bones, and then delete the second one by pressing the \"delete\" button.\n\nUsing the Exporter\n\nBefore installing any plugins, you must install the visual studio runtime system. To do so, execute vcredist_x86-sp1.exe as administrator. Then, to install the plugin, look in the panda3d \"plugins\" directory. There, you will find the plugins, such as maxegg5.dlo, maxegg6.dlo, and maxegg7.dlo. These are for 3D Studio Max versions 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Copy the correct file from the Panda3D plugins directory into the 3D Studio Max plugins directory, then, restart 3D Studio Max.",
