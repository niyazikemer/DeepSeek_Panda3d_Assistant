  "content": "DDS file format\n\nIn addition to Panda's native TXO file format, there is a fairly standard format called DDS, which has some of the same properties of TXO. Like TXO, you can store pre-compressed images in a DDS file. The biggest advantage of the DDS file format is that there are already several tools available on the internet to generate DDS files, including GIMP and Photoshop plugins.\n\nGenerating your own DDS files has several advantages; chief among them is that you have complete control over the compression artifacts of your texture and can result in less loss of quality since slower compression techniques may be used. However, it has the same issues as storing pre-compressed texture images in TXO files: there is a possibility some graphics cards don't support the texture compression you have used, in which case the texture will have to be decompressed before it can be loaded.\n\nTexture cache",
