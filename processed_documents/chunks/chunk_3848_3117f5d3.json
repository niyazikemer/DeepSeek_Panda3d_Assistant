  "content": "If you use the standard pickle module instead, the NodePaths will each\nduplicate its own copy of its scene graph.\n\nThis is necessary because the standard pickle module doesn't provide a\nmechanism for sharing context between different objects written to the\nsame pickle stream, so each NodePath has to write itself without\nknowing about the other NodePaths that will also be writing to the\nsame stream.  This replacement module solves this problem by defining\na ``__reduce_persist__()`` replacement method for ``__reduce__()``,\nwhich accepts a pointer to the Pickler object itself, allowing for\nshared context between all objects written by that Pickler.\n\nUnfortunately, cPickle cannot be supported, because it does not\nsupport extensions of this nature. \"\"\"\n\n__all__ = [\"PickleError\", \"PicklingError\", \"UnpicklingError\", \"Pickler\",\n           \"Unpickler\", \"dump\", \"dumps\", \"load\", \"loads\",\n           \"HIGHEST_PROTOCOL\", \"DEFAULT_PROTOCOL\"]",
