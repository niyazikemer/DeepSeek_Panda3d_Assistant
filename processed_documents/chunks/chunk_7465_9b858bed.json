It also contains knowledge of the connection over which it was received and the address of the connection. To retrieve the connection, use the getConnection method:\n\nsourceOfMessage = datagram.getConnection()\n\nTo retrieve the contents of the message, use the PyDatagramIterator. The iterator class acts as the complement of the PyDatagram class; its methods can be used to retrieve the content that was encoded using PyDatagram.\n\ndef myProcessDataFunction(netDatagram):\n    myIterator = PyDatagramIterator(netDatagram)\n    msgID = myIterator.getUint8()\n    if msgID == PRINT_MESSAGE:\n        messageToPrint = myIterator.getString()\n        print(messageToPrint)\n\nNote",
