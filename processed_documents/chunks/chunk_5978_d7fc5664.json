You can do this using the .Camera methods set_tag_state_key(key) <.Camera.set_tag_state_key> and set_tag_state(value, state) <.Camera.set_tag_state>. For any .NodePaths that you want to recieve special treatment you call set_tag(key, value) <.NodePath.set_tag> (see common-state-changes). Now, any time the camera sees an object with a tag named key, it is assigned whatever state is associated with value.\n\npython\n\n# Assume we have Shader instances toon_shader and blur_shader\n# and we have a Camera whose NodePath is myCamera",
