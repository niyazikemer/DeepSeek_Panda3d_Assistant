Sparkle particles appear to sparkle when viewed as being smaller than a pixel.\n\n4.1 \u2013 4.2) Color of the center and color of the edges.\n\n4.3 \u2013 4.4) Initial sparkle radius and final sparkle radius\n\n4.5) Whether or not sparkle is always of radius birthRadius\n\nSpriteParticleRender\n\nRenders particles as an image, using a Panda3D texture object. The image is always facing the user.\n\n5.1.1) On: Multitexture node will be animated, Off: only the first frame of a node will be rendered. One way to make such a node (textured quad) is egg-texture-cards program, which will take your image files and generate an egg file for you.
