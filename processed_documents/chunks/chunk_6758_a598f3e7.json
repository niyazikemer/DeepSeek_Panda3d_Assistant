This is\nmeaningful in non-production builds only. egg-unify bool 1 When this is true, then in addition to flattening the scene graph\nnodes, the egg loader will also combine as many Geoms as possible within\na given node into a single Geom. This has theoretical performance\nbenefits, especially on higher-end graphics cards, but it also slightly\nslows down egg loading. egg-unroll-fans bool 1 Set this true to allow the egg loader to convert weak triangle\nfans--triangles that share the same vertex but aren't connected enough\nto justify making a triangle fan primitive from them--into a series of\nzig-zag triangles that can make a triangle strip that might connect\nbetter with its neighbors. egg-vertex-max-num-joints int 4 Specifies the maximum number of distinct joints that are allowed to\ncontrol any one vertex. If a vertex requests assignment to more than\nthis number of joints, the joints with the lesser membership value are",
