  "content": "Animated Models\n\nThere are two classes in Panda3D for 3D Geometry: the 'Model', which is for non-animated geometry, and the 'Actor', which is for animated geometry.\n\nNote that a geometry is only considered animated if it changes shape. So for example, a baseball wouldn't be considered animated: it may fly all over the place, but it stays a sphere. A baseball would be a model, not an actor.\n\nThe following sections of the manual explain how to load and manipulate an animated model. They assume that you have a valid egg file (or other compatible format) which has an animatable model, and some additional egg files containing animations. To learn how to convert a model into an egg file see the asset-pipeline section.\n\nTo learn how to load a regular, non-animated model, see the model-files section.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nloading-actors-and-animations actor-animations multi-part-actors attaching-objects-to-joints controlling-joints",
