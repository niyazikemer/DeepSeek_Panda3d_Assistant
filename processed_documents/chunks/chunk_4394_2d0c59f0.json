  "content": "scaleFactor also controls the visual quality of the rendered\n        text characters.  It is the amount by which the characters are\n        rendered bigger out of Freetype, and then downscaled to fit\n        within the texture.  Increasing this number may reduce some\n        artifacts of very small font characters, at a small cost of\n        processing time to generate the characters initially.\n\n        textureMargin specifies the number of pixels of the texture to\n        leave between adjacent characters.  It may be a floating-point\n        number.  This helps reduce bleed-through from nearby\n        characters within the texture space.  Increasing this number\n        reduces artifacts at the edges of the character cells\n        (especially for very small text scales), at the expense of\n        texture memory.",
