  "content": "In linear mode, the onset and opaque distances of the fog are defined as offsets along the local forward (+Y) axis of the fog node. The onset distance is the distance from the fog node at which the fog will begin to have effect, and the opaque distance is the distance from the fog node at which the fog will be completely opaque. From reading the API page for the .Fog class, it sounds as if beyond this opaque point there is no fog (rather than continuing opaque fog up to the location of the fog node as you might expect): \"the fog will be rendered as if it extended along the vector from the onset point to the opaque point.\"\n\nThese settings can be modified using the methods ~.Fog.get_linear_onset_point(), ~.Fog.get_linear_opaque_point(), ~.Fog.set_linear_onset_point(), ~.Fog.set_linear_opaque_point() and ~.Fog.set_linear_range() of .Fog.\n\nThere is a hardware issue with rendering fog which means that linear fog can break down and vanish depending on the angle from which it is viewed:",
