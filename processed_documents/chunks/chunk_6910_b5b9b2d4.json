  "content": "Forces: Sets forces that can be used to move existing particles.\n\nPlay around with the panel for a while, and create something you like. You can then save the settings to a file with the extension ptf. You can also load that ptf later and continue to modify it. Some sample ptfs are included for inspiration. The Panel does need some improvements because it is somewhat buggy. It can crash, especially when dragged around, and forgets some settings when they are saved out to a ptf. It forgets to include the extension of the texture for a SpriteRenderer, so you need to open the file by hand and correct the loader.loadTexture command or it will not load. It also forgets to record the axis masks on forces.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
