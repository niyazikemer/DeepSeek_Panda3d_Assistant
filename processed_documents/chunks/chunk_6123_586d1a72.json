  "content": "Ambient Occlusion - applies a screen-space ambient occlusion filter.\n\nGamma Adjust - applies a gamma adjustment.\n\nsRGB Encode - ensures the image is encoded using the sRGB inverse EOTF.\n\nHigh Dynamic Range Filter - enables HDR rendering and tone mapping.\n\nExposure Adjust - applies exposure compensation before tone mapping.\n\nMSAA - enables multisample antialiasing.\n\nBasic Setup\n\nThe first step is to create an object of class CommonFilters. Pass in a pointer to your window, and your 3D camera:\n\nfilters = CommonFilters(base.win, base.cam)\n\nThis will have no effect until you enable a filter (instructions below.) Once a filter is enabled, class CommonFilters will reconfigure the Panda3D rendering as follows:\n\nIt will render the scene into an offscreen buffer, using the camera you provided.\n\nIt will remove the scene from the specified window, and replace it with a fullscreen quad.\n\nThe quad will be textured with the scene, plus a shader that implements whatever filter you have selected.",
