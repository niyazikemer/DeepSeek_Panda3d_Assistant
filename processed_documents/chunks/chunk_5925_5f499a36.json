  "content": "Reading existing geometry data\n\nYou can fairly easily extract and examine or operate on the vertices for an existing model, although you should be aware that the order in which the vertices appear in a model is undefined. There is no correlation between the order in which vertices are listed in an egg file, and the order in which they will appear in the resulting loaded model. Panda may rearrange the vertices, or even add or remove vertices, as needed to optimize the model for rendering performance. Even from one session to the next, the vertices might come out in a different order.",
