If\n        allowAsyncBind is False, this guarantees that the animation is\n        bound immediately--the animation is never bound in a\n        sub-thread; it will be loaded and bound in the main thread, so\n        it will be available by the time this method returns.\n\n        The parameters are the same as that for getAnimControls().  In\n        fact, this method is a thin wrapper around that other method.",
