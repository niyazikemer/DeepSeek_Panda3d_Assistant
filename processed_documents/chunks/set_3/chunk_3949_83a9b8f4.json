  "content": "\"\"\"\nClass CommonFilters implements certain common image\npostprocessing filters.  See the :ref:`common-image-filters` page for\nmore information about how to use these filters.\n\nThese filters are written in the Cg shading language.\n\"\"\"\n\n# It is not ideal that these filters are all included in a single\n# monolithic module.  Unfortunately, when you want to apply two filters\n# at the same time, you have to compose them into a single shader, and\n# the composition process isn't simply a question of concatenating them:\n# you have to somehow make them work together.  I suspect that there\n# exists some fairly simple framework that would make this automatable.\n# However, until I write some more filters myself, I won't know what\n# that framework is.  Until then, I'll settle for this\n# clunky approach.  - Josh",
