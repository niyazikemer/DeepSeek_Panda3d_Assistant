This can be used for\n        partial-body animations, for instance to animate a hand waving\n        while the rest of the body continues to play its walking\n        animation.\n\n        includeJoints is a list of joint names that are to be animated\n        by the subpart.  Each name can include globbing characters\n        like '?' or '*', which will match one or any number of\n        characters, respectively.  Including a joint by naming it in\n        includeJoints implicitly includes all of the descendents of\n        that joint as well, except for excludeJoints, below.",
