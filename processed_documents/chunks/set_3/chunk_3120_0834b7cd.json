  "content": "When animBlend is True, multiple different animations may\n        simultaneously be playing on the Actor.  This means you may\n        call play(), loop(), or pose() on multiple animations and have\n        all of them contribute to the final pose each frame.\n\n        In this mode (that is, when animBlend is True), starting a\n        particular animation with play(), loop(), or pose() does not\n        implicitly make the animation visible; you must also call\n        setControlEffect() for each animation you wish to use to\n        indicate how much each animation contributes to the final\n        pose.",
