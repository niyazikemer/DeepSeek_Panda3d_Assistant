  "content": "numThreads is the number of threads to allocate for this task\n        chain.  If it is 1 or more, then the tasks on this task chain\n        will execute in parallel with the tasks on other task chains.\n        If it is greater than 1, then the tasks on this task chain may\n        execute in parallel with themselves (within tasks of the same\n        sort value).\n\n        If tickClock is True, then this task chain will be responsible\n        for ticking the global clock each frame (and thereby\n        incrementing the frame counter).  There should be just one\n        task chain responsible for ticking the clock, and usually it\n        is the default, unnamed task chain.\n\n        threadPriority specifies the priority level to assign to\n        threads on this task chain.  It may be one of TPLow, TPNormal,\n        TPHigh, or TPUrgent.  This is passed to the underlying\n        threading system to control the way the threads are scheduled.",
