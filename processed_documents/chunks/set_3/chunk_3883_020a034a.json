  "content": "priority (int): the priority at which to run the task.  The\n                default priority is 0.  Higher priority tasks are run\n                sooner, and/or more often.  For historical purposes, if\n                you specify a priority without also specifying a sort,\n                the priority value is understood to actually be a sort\n                value. (Previously, there was no priority value, only a\n                sort value, and it was called \"priority\".)\n\n            uponDeath (bool): a function to call when the task\n                terminates, either because it has run to completion, or\n                because it has been explicitly removed.\n\n            taskChain (str): the name of the task chain to assign the\n                task to.",
