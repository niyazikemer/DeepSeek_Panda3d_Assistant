  "content": "Each of the above has a similar set of parameters as those of LerpPosInterval. They also have a similar shortcut (e.g. model.hprInterval(), etc.) Finally, there is a handful of combination LerpIntervals that perform multiple lerps at the same time. (You can also achieve the same effect by combining several LerpIntervals within a Parallel <sequences-and-parallels>, but these combination intervals are often simpler to use, and they execute just a bit faster.)",
