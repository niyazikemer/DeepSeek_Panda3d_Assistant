  "content": "Some game developers, when they see that their programs are running slow, often react by trying to reduce the number of polygons. This almost never makes any difference whatsoever. Back in the mid-90's, reducing polygon counts was a reasonable strategy to make games faster. That strategy just doesn't work anymore. The reason for this is that video card manufacturers have been increasing the polygon limits of their video cards by leaps and bounds. In fact, they've raised the polygon limit so high that you almost never hit that limit anymore: you usually hit some other limit first.\n\nThat's the key to modern performance tuning: knowing all the limits of the machine other than the polygon limit, and figuring out which of those limitations you've run into. In other words, the key to modern performance tuning is diagnosis. The methodology for performance optimization therefore looks like this:",
