  "content": "Sample Programs: Motion Trails\n\nTo run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.\n\nScreenshots\n\nExplanation\n\nThese sample programs shows two different ways to create motion trails in panda. The first one is a geometry-based method, which uses the ~direct.motiontrail.MotionTrail.MotionTrail class (which is a wrapper around the C++ class .CMotionTrail) in order to extrude a cross-section of geometry along the path that an object takes. This method can be used to achieve a wide range of effects, and is usually applied applied to individual objects.",
