This is most useful for keys like \"shift\" or \"enter\", which may be called differently on different keyboards or in different languages. However, this is both system-dependent and locale-dependent. You should not rely on it being present, and if it is, you should not rely on consistent formatting or capitalization.\n\nOf course, it is always advisable to still add in a configuration screen so that users can customize key bindings in case they find a particular control scheme difficult to use.",
