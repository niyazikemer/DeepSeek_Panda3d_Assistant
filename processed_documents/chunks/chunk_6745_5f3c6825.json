It\nis false by default, since flat-shaded geometry is rare; but you may\nwish to set it true if your scene largely or entirely consists of\nflat-shaded polygons. egg-flatten bool 1 This is normally true to flatten out useless nodes after loading an\negg file. Set it false if you want to see the complete and true\nhierarchy as the egg loader created it (although the extra nodes may\nhave a small impact on render performance). egg-flatten-radius double 0.0 This specifies the minimum cull radius in the egg file. Nodes whose\nbounding volume is smaller than this radius will be flattened tighter\nthan nodes larger than this radius, to reduce the node count even\nfurther. The idea is that small objects will not need to have their\nindividual components culled separately, but large environments should.",
