  "content": "Animations\n\nThe EGG format is somewhat unique in that animations can be stored in a separate Egg file. In fact, the most common approach is to have one Egg file containing the model and its joint hierarchy, and to have a separate Egg file for each animation that acts on this joint hierarchy. These files are then specified together when loading the animated model <loading-actors-and-animations> into Panda3D. This is what you will see in the models that are shipped with the sample programs.\n\nHowever, this is not strictly necessary, and an Egg file can be produced that contains both the model and its associated animations.\n\nLimitations\n\nEgg files are less suitable as a format for storing whole scenes, because they lack the ability to store information about light sources. However, if need be, this information can still be passed from the modelling program via custom tags added to dummy objects.\n\nSample Files",
