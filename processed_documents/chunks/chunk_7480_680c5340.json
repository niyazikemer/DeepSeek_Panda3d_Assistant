  "content": "For instance, when Panda draws each display region in single-threaded mode, it performs a cull traversal followed by a draw traversal for each display region. Thus, if your Panda client includes multiple display regions, it will alternate its time spent culling and drawing as it processes each of them. The strip chart, however, reports only the total cull time and draw time spent.\n\nSometimes you really need to know the sequence of events in the frame, not just the total time spent in each collector. The piano roll chart shows this kind of data. It is so named because it is similar to the paper music roll for an old-style player piano, with holes punched down the roll for each note that is to be played. The longer the hole, the longer the piano key is held down. (Think of the chart as rotated 90 degrees from an actual piano roll. A player piano roll plays from bottom to top; the piano roll chart reads from left to right.)",
