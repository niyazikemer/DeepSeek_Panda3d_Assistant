  "content": "The running Panda client suggests its target frame rate, as well as the initial vertical scale of the graph (that is, the height of the colored bars). You can change the scale freely by clicking within the graph itself and dragging the mouse up or down as necessary. One of the horizontal guide bars is drawn in a lighter shade of gray; this one represents the actual target frame rate suggested by the client. The other, darker, guide bars are drawn automatically at harmonic subdivisions of the target frame rate. You can change the target frame rate with the Config.prc variable pstats-target-frame-rate on the client.\n\nYou can also create any number of user-defined guide bars by dragging them into the graph from the gray space immediately above or below the graph. These are drawn in a dashed blue line. It is sometimes useful to place one of these to mark a performance level so it may be compared to future values (or to alternate configurations).",
