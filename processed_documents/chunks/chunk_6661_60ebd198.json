  "content": "The above assigns 3-D texture coordinates to the teapot based on the (x, y, z) positions of its vertices, which is a common way to assign 3-D texture coordinates. The setTexPos() and setTexScale() calls in the above are particular to the teapot model; these numbers are chosen to scale the texture so that its unit cube covers the teapot.\n\nStoring 3-D texture maps on disk is a bit of a problem, since most image formats only support 2-D images. By convention, then, Panda3D will store a 3-D texture image by slicing it into horizontal cross-sections and writing each slice as a separate 2-D image. When you load a 3-D texture, you specify a series of 2-D images which Panda3D will load and stack up like pancakes to make the full 3-D image.\n\nThe above 3-D texture image, for instance, is stored as four separate image files:\n\nNote that, although the image is stored as four separate images on disk, internally Panda3D stores it as a single, three-dimensional image, with height, width, and depth.",
