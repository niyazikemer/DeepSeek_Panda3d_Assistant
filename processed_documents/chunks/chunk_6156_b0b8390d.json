  "content": "Do not enable transparency modes unless it is necessary, and when you do, consider using the M_binary mode, which does not require back-to-front sorting. However, if alpha blending is required and if large areas of the polygons are fully transparent, using M_dual may provide an improvement over M_alpha.\n\nFor a more in-depth explanation on the various transparency modes, see transparency-and-blending.",
