  "content": "Accessing Config Vars in a Program\n\nPanda3D uses a configuration file <configuring-panda3d> named Config.prc. Panda3D supplies functions to easily read values out of Config.prc, and to alter their values in memory (the modified values are not written back out to disk). The ability to read and alter configuration settings procedurally has two major uses:\n\nStoring your own configuration data.\n\nTweaking Panda3D's behavior.\n\n\"Storing your own configuration data\" means that your game might have its own settings that need to be stored. Rather than writing your own configuration file parser, you might consider adding your configuration data to the panda configuration file instead.\n\nSuppose hypothetically that you are writing an online game, and your online game connects to a server. You need a configuration file to tell you the name of the server. Open up the \"Config.prc\" file and add the following line at the end of the file.\n\nmy-game-server panda3dgame.com",
