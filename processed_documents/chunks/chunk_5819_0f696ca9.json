  "content": "The formats supported by this plug-in are OpenFlight (.flt), LightWave (.lwo), AutoCAD (.dxf), VRML (.wrl), Direct X (.x), and Wavefront OBJ (.obj). However, note that some of these formats can be loaded by the Assimp loader, in which case this plug-in is only used if the Assimp plug-in is not available. Also note that the obj2egg converter is extremely limited and does not support materials or textures, so it is not recommended to load .obj files via this route.\n\nSupported Feature Table\n\nThis table lists the most commonly used supported file formats and the features that are supported by these formats and their respective importers:",
