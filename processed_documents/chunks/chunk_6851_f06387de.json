The main reason to set this false\nis to test your code in the absence of stencil buffer support. support-threads bool 1 Set this false to disallow the creation of threads using Panda's\nThread interface, even if threading support is compiled in. This does\nnot affect the operation of mutexes and other synchronization\nprimitives, just the creation of threads. swap-eyes bool 0 Set this true to reverse the left and right channel output of stereo\nDisplayRegions. sync-flip bool 0 Set this true to attempt to flip all windows at the same time, or\nfalse to flip each window as late as possible. Setting this false can\nimprove parallelization. This is a temporary variable; it will later be\nreplaced with a more explicit control over synchronizing window\nflip. sync-video bool 1 Configure this true to request the rendering to sync to the video",
