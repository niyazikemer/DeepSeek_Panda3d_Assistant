See also gl-interleaved-arrays. gl-separate-specular-color bool 1 When separate specular mode is on, the specular component will be\nwritten to the secondary instead of the primary color, which is added\nafter the texturing stage. In other words, the specular highlight will\nbe unmodulated by the color of the texture. gl-show-texture-usage bool 0 If you set this true, the screen will flash with textures drawn in a\nspecial mode that shows the mipmap detail level and texture size for\neach texture. Textures will be drawn in blue for mipmap level 0, yellow\nfor mipmap level 1, and red for all higher mipmap levels. Brighter",
