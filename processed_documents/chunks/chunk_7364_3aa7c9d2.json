  "content": "The image is less often used. It is the filename of a texture image (or an already-loaded Texture object). It is intended for displaying a simple texture image for which you don't already have a model created via egg-texture-cards. A default card will be created to display this texture, with a bounding box of (-1, 0, -1) to (1, 0, 1); that is, a square with sides of length 2 units, centered on the origin. You can position and scale this card with the keywords image_pos and image_scale. See also onscreenimage.\n\nFinally, the DirectGui may have a frame created for it. This is typically a gray rectangular background with an optional bevel. There are a handful of different frame styles; you can use the relief keyword to select from one of the available styles; your choices are SUNKEN, RAISED, GROOVE, or RIDGE. You can also specify relief = None to avoid creating a frame polygon altogether (this is commonly done when you have specified your own geom object with the geom keyword).",
