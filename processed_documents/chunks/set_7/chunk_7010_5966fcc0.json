(You can check the block count by calling terrain.getRoot().analyze().) If it is too high, try increasing the block size, or enable AutoFlattening, which will reduce the block count to only one. The autoflatten function was created because normally you can't flatten a terrain using the normal flattenX methods, because this will interfere with the GeoMipTerrain's updating system.",
