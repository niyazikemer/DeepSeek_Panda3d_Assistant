  "content": "List of Possible Cg Shader Inputs\n\nCaution\n\nSupport for Cg shaders will be deprecated in an upcoming version of Panda3D.\n\nIn many cases, it is desirable to access information from the render state or from the 3-D transformation of the node that is currently being rendered. Instead of having to pass all this information manually, it is possible to name your variables in a special way that Panda3D will recognize and automatically populate with the relevant data.\n\nThe following table describes the inputs that can be used in Cg shaders.\n\nUsing Custom Shader Inputs\n\nAs of Panda3D 1.8.0, the capabilities for passing numeric shader inputs have been greatly enhanced. The available input types are as follows:\n\nVec4\n- Vec3\n- Vec2\n- Point4\n- Point3\n- Point2\n- Mat4\n- Mat3\n- PTALMatrix4f\n- PTALMatrix3f\n- PTALVecBase4f\n- PTALVecBase3f\n- PTALVecBase2f\n- PTAFloat\n- PTADouble",
