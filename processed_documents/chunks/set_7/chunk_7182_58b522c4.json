It can be activated using the following configuration variable:\n\ngl-immutable-texture-storage true\n\nMemory barriers\n\nWhenever you write to an image using an image2D uniform, Panda3D assumes that the image has been modified by the shader. Panda3D will automatically issue a memory barrier when the texture is used in a following operation, such as when the texture is used for rendering or bound to a different shader, to make sure that the reads and writes are synchronized.",
