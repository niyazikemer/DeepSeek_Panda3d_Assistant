  "content": "Converting from Blender\n\nCurrently, there are several ways to get models from Blender into Panda3D. The most popular has always been the YABEE exporter, but it is no longer recommended as it is not compatible with the latest version of Blender, 2.80. Instead, we recommend the use of blend2bam, or to export to the glTF format <gltf-files>.\n\nPlease note that some of these tools rely on features that were introduced in Panda3D 1.10.8, so please make sure you are using the latest stable version of Panda3D.\n\nOption 1: blend2bam",
