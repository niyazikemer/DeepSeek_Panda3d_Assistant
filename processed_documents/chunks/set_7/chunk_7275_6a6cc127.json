Capsule shapes are a good choice for character controllers, since they are fast, symmetrical, and allow smooth movement over steps.\n\nTo create a capsule shape we have to pass the capsule's radius, the height of the cylindrical part, and the up-axis. The total height of the capsule will be the height of the cylindrical part, plus twice the radius.\n\npython\n\nfrom panda3d.bullet import BulletCapsuleShape\nradius = 0.5\nheight = 1.0\nshape = BulletCapsuleShape(radius, height, ZUp)\n\ncpp\n\n#include \"bulletCapsuleShape.h\"\n...\ndouble radius = 0.5;\ndouble height = 1.0;\nPT(BulletCapsuleShape) capsule_shape = new BulletCapsuleShape(radius, height);",
