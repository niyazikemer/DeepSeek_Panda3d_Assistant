  "content": "Level of Detail\n\nTo make a scene look as good as possible, modellers often like to make them very intricately detailed, which requires a model to consist of a high amount of polygons. However, if every model in a scene were so highly detailed, Panda3D would spend a lot of time animating and rendering the scene every frame, causing the performance to drop.\n\nA common technique to prevent this is to create multiple levels of detail for a model. A highly detailed version of the model is used when it is close to the camera, whereas if the model is far away, a lower resolution version is used, since the detail is not discernable at a great distance anyway.\n\nAnother use would be to combine several small objects into a simplified single object, or to apply a shader that is less costly to render at a greater distance. LOD can also be used to hide objects when they are far away.\n\ncpp\n\nInclude file:\n\n#include \"lodNode.h\"\n\nTo create an .LODNode and .NodePath:\n\npython",
