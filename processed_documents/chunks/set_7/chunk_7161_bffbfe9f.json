To do this, use ~.DisplayRegion.set_sort():\n\npython\n\ndr.setSort(sortValue)\n\ncpp\n\ndr->set_sort(sortValue);\n\nThe sortValue can be any integer number; the default is zero. All DisplayRegions for a particular window will be drawn in order from smallest sort first to largest sort last. If two DisplayRegions have the same sort value, the order in which they are drawn is undefined.",
