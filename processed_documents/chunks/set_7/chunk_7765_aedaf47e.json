  "content": "In light of this, Panda3D 1.9.0 introduced some features that will help to solve this problem. The easiest way to fix this problem is to instead refer to the keys by how they would appear on an ANSI US (QWERTY) keyboard layout. To do this, you can prepend the raw- prefix to any key event. This will cause Panda3D to ignore the user's configured keyboard layout, and instead report the key as if the user had set his keyboard layout to ANSI US. It does this by interpreting the raw scancode as sent by the hardware, rather than the virtual key as reported by the operating system. (Note that raw events do not have prefixes for modifier keys.)",
