  "content": "The frame time in milliseconds, averaged over the past three seconds, is drawn above the upper right corner of the graph. The labels on the guide bars on the right are also shown in milliseconds; if you prefer to think about a target frame rate rather than an elapsed time in milliseconds, you may find it useful to select \"Hz\" from the Units pulldown menu, which changes the time units accordingly. As of Panda3D 1.10.13, a counter may also be shown in the top-right corner keeping track of how many times during a frame the collector is started.",
