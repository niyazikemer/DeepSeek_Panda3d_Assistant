  "content": "People sometimes have the mistaken impression that Panda3D is written in Python, which would make it very slow. But Panda3D is not written in Python; it's written in C++. Python is just used for scripting. Developers usually write the performance-intensive bits, if any, in C++ or something similar Cython. To see what kind of framerate a small Panda3D program typically gets, take a look at the screenshots of the Sample Programs <samples>. Those were taken using an old Radeon x700. Of course, only a sample program can run at 400 fps like that, but for a real game, 60 fps is quite attainable. One caveat, though: to get that kind of performance, you need to understand 3D cards and 3D performance optimization. It doesn't happen automatically. Panda3D includes profiling tools you need to hit 60 fps.\n\nPanda3D's Software License",
