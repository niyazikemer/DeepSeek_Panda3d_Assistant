  "content": "Note that the size you choose for the texture image has nothing to do with the size or shape of the texture image onscreen--that's controlled by the size and shape of the polygon you apply it to. Making a texture image larger won't make it appear larger onscreen, but it will tend to make it crisper and more detailed. Similarly, making a texture smaller will tend to make it fuzzier.\n\nPadded Textures\n\nSometimes, you need to load data into a texture every frame. The most common example is when you're playing a movie. Let's say, for example, that the movie is encoded at 640x480 at 30fps. Neither of those dimensions is a power-of-two. It would theoretically be possible for Panda3D to rescale the image to 512x512, but it would have to do it 30 times per second, which is too expensive to be practical.",
