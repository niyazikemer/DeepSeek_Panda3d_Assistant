  "content": "Reference Counting\n\nReference Counts\n\nTo manage the lifetime of objects, Panda3D has a reference counting system for many objects. This means that for every object that uses this mechanism, a reference count is kept which counts the number of references exist to that object. Every time a new reference is made (eg. assigned to a new variable), the reference count is increased. When the reference count reaches zero, the object is deleted.\n\nThis is similar to Python's reference counting system, and in fact, the two systems interact when Panda3D is used with Python. However, since an object's lifetime may persist beyond the lifetime of an object in Python, Python's own reference counting system alone is not sufficient.\n\npython",
