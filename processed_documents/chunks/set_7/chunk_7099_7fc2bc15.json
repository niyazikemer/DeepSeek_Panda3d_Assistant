  "content": "Next we create a rigid body and add the previously created shape. BulletRigidBodyNode is derived from PandaNode, and thus the rigid body can be placed within the Panda3D scene graph. you can also use methods like setPos or setH to place the rigid body node where you want it to be.\n\nFinally we need to attach the newly created rigid body node to the world. Only rigid bodies attached to the world will be considered when advancing the simulation state.\n\nDynamic bodies\n\nDynamic bodies are similar to static bodies. Except that dynamic bodies can be moved around the world by applying force or torque. To setup a dynamic body is almost the same as for static bodies. We will have to set one additional property though, the body's mass. Setting a positive finite mass will create a dynamic body, while setting the mass to zero will create a static body. Zero mass is a convention for setting an infinite mass, which is the same as making the body unmovable (static).\n\npython",
