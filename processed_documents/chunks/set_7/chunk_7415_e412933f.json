  "content": "Wander\n\n'Wander' is an AI behavior where an AICharacter will move in a random direction to generate realistic movement around an environment with no goal position in mind.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy6F6HnenoE\n\nIn PandAI, 'Wander' is defined as :\n\naiBehaviors.wander(double wander_radius, int flag, double aoe, float priority)\n\nwhere :\n\nWander Radius represents the degree of wandering. This is implemented via a guiding circle in front of the AI Character.\n\nFlag represents which plane to wander in (0 - XY, 1 - YZ, 2 - XZ, 3 - XYZ). By default, it is in the XY plane.\n\nArea of Effect is the radius from the starting point where the AICharacter would wander within.\n\npriority is by default set to 1.0 and is used when using two or more steering behaviors on an AICharacter.\n\nThe velocity at which the AICharacter wanders is determined when you first create your AICharacter object using the AICharacter constructor.\n\nThe full working code for this in Panda3D :",
