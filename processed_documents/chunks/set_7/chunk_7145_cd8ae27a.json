  "content": "It helps the texture look much smoother than filtering alone when it is minified.\n\nMipmapping doesn't have anything at all to do with magnification.\n\nIt has a tendency to blur minified textures out a little too much, especially when the texture is applied to a polygon that is very nearly edge-on to the camera.\n\nThere are four different filter types that involve mipmapping, but you almost always want to use just the last one, FT_linear_mipmap_linear. The other modes are for advanced uses, and sometimes can be used to tweak the mipmap artifacts a bit (especially to reduce point 4, above). If you don't understand the description in the table above, it's not worth worrying about.\n\npython\n\ntexture.setMinfilter(SamplerState.FT_linear_mipmap_linear)\n\ncpp\n\ntexture->set_minfilter(SamplerState::FT_linear_mipmap_linear);\n\nAnisotropic Filtering",
