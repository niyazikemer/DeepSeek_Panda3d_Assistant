The exact set to use varies again depending on which features of Panda3D are used. This list is a reasonable default set:\n\nlibp3framework.lib\nlibpanda.lib\nlibpandaexpress.lib\nlibp3dtool.lib\nlibp3dtoolconfig.lib\nlibp3direct.lib\n\nThis should be enough to at least build the project. Press F7 to build your project and start the compilation process. You may see several C4267 warnings; these are harmless, and you may suppress them in your project settings.",
