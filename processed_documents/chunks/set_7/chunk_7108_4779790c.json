  "content": "Most types of DirectGui objects do not use this state system, and only have one state, which is state 0. The DirectButton is presently the only predefined object that has more than one state defined by default. In fact, DirectButton defines four states, numbered 0 through 3, which are called ready, press, rollover, and disabled, in that order. Furthermore, the DirectButton automatically manages its current state into one of these states, according to the user's interaction with the mouse.",
