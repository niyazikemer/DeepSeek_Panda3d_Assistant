  "content": "Bullet Constraints\n\nConstraints limit the movement of two rigid bodies in relation to each other, or the movement of one body in relation to the global world space. Another often used term word for constraints is joint.\n\nConstraint Types\n\nThe following different types of constraints are supported by Bullet:\n\nHinge Constraint\n\nThe hinge constraint has restricts movement of two bodies by means of a shared axis. The axis is defined by a pivot point on each body (within the body's local space). Hinge constraints can be used for example to model doors or chests.\n\nSlider Constraint\n\nThe slider constraint allows the two bodies to move along a shared piston. Rotation around the piston can be limited, if this is required.\n\nSpherical Constraint\n\nThe spherical constraint models a ball-and-socket connection between two rigid bodies.\n\nCone Twist Constraint",
