However, there are many good tools out there like Z-Brush, Crazy Bump, and the like which create normal maps.\n\nSee also: bump-mapping\n\nNormal maps only function when shader generation <the-shader-generator> is enabled.\n\nHeight / Parallax Map Mode\n\nAs an addition to normal mapping, you can specify a grayscale height map to enable parallax mapping. This technique offsets the UV coordinates based on the height value and eye normal vector, so the resulting surface will have more apparent depth. Currently, Panda only supports one height map per polygon, additional height maps will be ignored.\n\npython",
