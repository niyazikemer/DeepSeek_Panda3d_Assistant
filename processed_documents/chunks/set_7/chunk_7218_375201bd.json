  "content": "However there are certain situations when you need to do some heavy calculations yourself and Python can be up to 100x slower than C++. This does not mean you need to abandon Python and rewrite all your code in C++ for that single bottleneck. Only that single function or class can be ported to C++ and called from your Python code.\n\nTo determine whether it is the Python code that is slowing down an application, you should use PStats <measuring-performance-with-pstats>. As of Panda3D version 1.10.13, you can set the pstats-python-profiler Config.prc variable to get a detailed view of how much time each Python module, class and function is taking up. To access this view, in the Frame strip chart, double-click the App collector on the left side, then double-click the Python collector. Then, you can drill down further into the packages, modules, classes and functions.\n\nBefore considering writing any C++ code, consider other options:",
