Presto, you will see the effects of normal mapping.\n\nIf you are doing this in a program, the steps are basically the same: load a model which already has normal maps, set up some lights, and turn on per-pixel lighting. The sample program Tut-Normal-Mapping-Basic shows this process.\n\nDoing it the Hard Way\n\nThe problem with panda's shader synthesis capabilities is that they can only synthesize the shaders that people usually need. If what you need is esoteric, you'll have to write your own shader.",
