This disables assertion messages and other debugging aids to create a more optimized, slimmer and faster version of Panda3D. You can also choose to omit the features of Panda3D that you don't need, or exclude the third-party packages that have incompatible licensing terms.\n\nYou can do so by checking out the source code of Panda3D and running the makepanda.py build script with the --optimize 4 flag. Run it with --help to see a list of packages and components that can be excluded.",
