  "content": "Seek\n\n'Seek' is a behavior where an AICharacter moves in the direction of a target NodePath or position until it reaches that entity.\n\nVideo of this behavior in Panda3D:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UMeYgZLa8Q\n\nIn PandAI, seek is defined as :\n\naiBehaviors.seek(NodePath target, float priority)\naiBehaviors.seek(Vec3 position, float priority)\n\npriority is by default set to 1.0 and is used when using two or more steering behaviors on an AICharacter.\n\nThe velocity at which the AICharacter seeks is determined when you first create your AICharacter object using the AICharacter constructor.\n\nNote\n\nSeek's direction is calculated only during the first instance of the call and so is more efficient than pursue, if all you want is an object to go to a point.\n\nHere is a full program written implementing 'seek' using PandAI :",
