  "content": "Common State Changes\n\nThis page lists some of the most common changes you can make to a 3D node. This page is really only a quick cheat-sheet summary: the detailed documentation for these operations comes later in the manual. A full list of manipulations can be found on the API reference page for the .NodePath class.\n\nPositioning Nodes\n\nTwo of the most common changes are position and orientation.\n\npython\n\nmyNodePath.setPos(X, Y, Z)\nmyNodePath.setHpr(Yaw, Pitch, Roll)\n\ncpp\n\nmyNodePath.set_pos(X, Y, Z);\nmyNodePath.set_hpr(Yaw, Pitch, Roll);\n\nBy default in Panda3D, the X axis points to the right, the Y axis is forward, and Z is up. An object's rotation is usually described using Euler angles called Heading, Pitch, and Roll (sometimes called Yaw, Pitch, and Roll in other packages)--these specify angle rotations in degrees. (If you are more comfortable using quaternions, the ~.NodePath.set_quat() method can be used to specify the rotation as a quaternion.)",
