  "content": "You can define your own custom columns. If there are any columns that have a name that Panda does not recognize, Panda will not do anything special with the column, but it can still send it to the graphics card. Of course, it is then up to you to write a vertex shader <shader-basics> that understands what to do with the data in the column.\n\nIt is possible to break up a GeomVertexData into more than one array. A GeomVertexArrayData is a table of vertex data that is stored in one contiguous block of memory. Typically, each GeomVertexData consists of just one array; but it is also possible to distribute the data so that some columns are stored in one array, while other columns are stored in another array:\n\nvertex texcoord 0 (1, 0, 0) (1, 0) 1 (1, 1, 0) (1, 1) 2 (0, 1, 0) (0, 1) 3 (0, 0, 0) (0, 0)\n\nnormal color 0 (0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 1, 1) 1 (0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 1, 1) 2 (0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 1, 1) 3 (0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 1, 1)",
