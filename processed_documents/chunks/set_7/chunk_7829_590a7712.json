Often, you will want the card to be semitransparent, which you can achieve by specifying an alpha value of 0.2 or 0.3 to the setCardColor() method.\n\nThe parameters to setCardAsMargin() are the same as those for setFrameAsMargin(), above: the distance to extend the card beyond the left, right, bottom, and top edges, respectively. (In this example, we have both the card and the frame on at the same time, and you can see that the card exactly fits the text, while the frame extends a little bit beyond--showing the effects of the slightly different parameters passed to setFrameAsMargin() and setCardAsMargin() in this example.)",
