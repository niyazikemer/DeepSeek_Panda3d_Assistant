  "content": "Also included in this update is the ability to use Point Objects as locators (similar to Maya's locators). Prior to now, an artist had to egg out a max scene using the model option and using joints as locators. Now with the addition of point objects, an artist can use the static option and place locators for wherever a position needs to be stored. NOTE: point objects do not get included in animated models, only in static ones.\n\nKnown Issues\n\nCurrently, you have to use the option 'Export Entire Scene' when having animated models, otherwise the character hierarchy might not be exported correctly.",
