Hence, to use them you need to get a reference to it via 'getAiBehaviors()' function of the AICharacter class.\n\nOnce you get this reference, you can use it to call any steering behavior.\n\naiBehaviors = aiCharacter.getAiBehaviors();\naiBehaviors.seek(targetNodePath);\n\nOnce you have read this page, you can proceed to explore the individual pages for each AI Behavior for details and even an example demo for each one working.\n\nPRIORITIES :",
