  "content": "Bullet Softbody Tetrahedron\n\nThe last kind of soft bodies are those made up from tetrahedral meshes. A tetrahedral mesh is a mesh where the single elements are not triangles, but tetrahedrons, that is \"pyramids\" with four corners. Tetrahedral meshes are sometimes called \"volume\" meshes, since they fill out a volume and not just the surface of the mesh.\n\nSetup\n\nSetup for tetrahedral soft bodies is more complicated than the previously shown soft body types, since we first have to get the data which describes a tetrahedral mesh. Common 3D modelling packages usually don't support for modelling tetrahedral meshes.\n\nIf we somehow have assumed the tetrahedral data we can set up the soft body directly from the vertices and indices. Let's assume we have the vertices as a list of triples (three times a floating point coordinate), and we have the tetrahedron indices as a list of four-tuples (four indices make up one tetrahedron).\n\npython",
