To do so, use .load_prc_file(). Note that filename-syntax uses a forward slash even under Windows.\n\npython\n\nfrom panda3d.core import loadPrcFile\n\nloadPrcFile(\"config/Config.prc\")\n\ncpp\n\n#include \"load_prc_file.h\"\n\nload_prc_file(\"config/Config.prc\");\n\nThe filename you specify is searched for along the model-path, in the same way that an Egg or Bam file is searched for when you use loader.loadModel() <direct.showbase.Loader.Loader.loadModel>.\n\npython\n\nYou should load your own PRC file before instantiating ShowBase. Changing certain configuration variables later on may not affect the window/environment that has already been created.\n\ncpp",
