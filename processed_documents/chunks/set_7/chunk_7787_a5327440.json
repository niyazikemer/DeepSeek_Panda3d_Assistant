  "content": ".DistributedSmoothNode.activateSmoothing(smoothing, prediction)\n\nThe activateSmoothing method will tell the instance of the SmoothNode to enable or disable smoothing of the movement on other connected clients. They will see the player move rather seamlessly instead of a choppy placement every few frames, dependent on how fast the network connection is. Though, even if they move smoothly, they may lag behind by some amount. Therefore, the prediction flag can be set. If predictive smoothing is on, the nodes will be drawn as nearly as possible in their current position, by extrapolating from old position reports.\n\n.DistributedSmoothNode.startSmooth()\n\nAfter activating the smoothing, it also has to be started. With this call the underlying task that will handle the logic is run. Note though, while the task is running, you won't be able to lerp the node or directly position it, as it would be overwritten by the update task.",
