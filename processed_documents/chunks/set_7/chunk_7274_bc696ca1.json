We can create a cylinder shape by either passing it's radius, height and cylinder axis, or by passing a vector with half extents and the cylinder axis. The following example creates two cylinder shapes, both with radius 0.5 and height 1.4.\n\npython\n\nfrom panda3d.bullet import BulletCylinderShape\nradius = 0.5\nheight = 1.4\nshape1 = BulletCylinderShape(radius, height, ZUp)\nshape2 = BulletCylinderShape(Vec3(radius, 0, 0.5 * height), ZUp)\n\ncpp\n\n#include \"bulletCylinderShape.h\"\n...\ndouble radius = 0.5;\ndouble height = 1.4;\nPT(BulletCylinderShape) cylinder_shape_one = new BulletCylinderShape(radius, height);\n\nCapsule Shape",
