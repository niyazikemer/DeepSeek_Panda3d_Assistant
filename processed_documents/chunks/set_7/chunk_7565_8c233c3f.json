  "content": "The faces are laid out according to the following diagram:\n\nImagine that you cut out the above diagram and folded it into a cube. You'd end up with something like this:\n\nNote that, when you hold the cube so that the axis indications for each face are in the appropriate direction (as in the picture above), several of the faces are upside-down or sideways. That's because of the way the graphics card manufacturers decided to lay out the cube map faces (and also because of Panda3D's default coordinate system). But in fact, it doesn't matter which way the faces are oriented, as long as you always generate your cube map images the same way.\n\nIn some sense, a cube map is a kind of surface texture, like an ordinary 2-D texture. But in another sense, it is also volumetric like a 3-D texture: every point within the 3-D texture coordinate space is colored according to the face of the cube it comes closest to. A sphere model with the cube map applied to it would pick up the same six faces:",
