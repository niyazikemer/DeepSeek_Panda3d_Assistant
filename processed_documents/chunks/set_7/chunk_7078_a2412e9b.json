It sticks the 640x480 movie into the lower-left corner of the texture. Then, it adds a black border to the right edge and top edge of the movie, padding it out to 1024x512.\n\nFrom that point forward, it's just a texture with a movie in the lower-left corner, and black bars on the upper and right sides. However, if you use UV coordinates carefully, you can cause just the movie to be displayed. To do this, you need to know how big those black bars are:\n\npadx = texture.getPadXSize()\npady = texture.getPadYSize()\n\nPanda3D only uses padded textures in a few very special cases: 1. When playing a non-power-of-two movie. 2. When using render-to-texture, and a non-power-of-two buffer.\n\nNonstandard Texture Sizes",
