  "content": "Spherical Constraint\n\nThe spherical constraint models a ball-and-socket connection between two rigid bodies.\n\nCone Twist Constraint\n\nThe cone twist constraint is a specialized version of the spherical constraint. It allows to limit the rotation and the swing (in both perpendicular directions).\n\nGeneric Constraint\n\nThe generic constraint allows movement in all six degrees of freedom, and it allows to limit this movement as desired.\n\nConstraint between two rigid bodies\n\nAll constraints can be created and used in similar ways, so we will explain only one constraint in detail, the .BulletConeTwistConstraint. For other constraints, please refer to the API documentation.\n\nWe assume that we already have created two rigid body nodes, and npA and npB are NodePaths for these rigid body nodes. For example like the two boxes created in the following snippet\n\npython\n\nshape = BulletBoxShape(Vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5))",
