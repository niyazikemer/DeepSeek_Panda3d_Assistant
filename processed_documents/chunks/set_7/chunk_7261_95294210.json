  "content": "Memory Full\n\nA floating-point number takes four bytes. Just one vertex contains (X,Y,Z), and a normal, and a texture coordinate. An RGBA color takes four bytes, so a 1024x1024 texture is four megabytes. Do the math, and you'll see how fast it all adds up.\n\nIf CPU memory is used excessively, it is possible to use PStats to find out which Panda3D structures are using the most memory. Click the \"System memory\" graph, and then navigate down into the various subcollectors to find out the cause of the high memory consumption.\n\nAlso see the page failure-to-garbage-collect for a possible cause of CPU memory filling up.",
