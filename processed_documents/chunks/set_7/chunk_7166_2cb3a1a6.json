  "content": "Compute Shaders\n\nIntroduction\n\nCompute shaders, introduced in 1.9, are a type of general-purpose shader program that can be used to perform a wide variety of functions on the video card. They are fundamentally different from other types of shaders in that they aren't assigned to a node and modify how the node is rendered, but are executed (dispatched) in a standalone fashion and perform an operation on an arbitrary set of data. They may read from and write to texture images at will. This is particularly useful for image processing or GPU-based particle algorithms, to name a few examples.\n\nCompute shaders are only available on hardware supporting OpenGL 4.3, which includes NVIDIA GeForce 400 series and above and AMD Radeon HD 5000 series and above.",
