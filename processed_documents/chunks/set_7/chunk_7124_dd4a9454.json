To do this we need two objects: A seeker and a target. For this example, we will use Ralph (seeker) and an arrow model (target).\n\nStep 5:\n\nCreate an 'AICharacter' object and attach it to your AIWorld class (previously created). The AICharacter constructor looks for a NodePath, this can be a Model or an Actor or even an Empty NodePath.\n\nStep 6:\n\nGet a reference to the AIBehaviors object of your previously created AICharacter class via the 'getAiBehaviors' function().\n\nStep 7:",
