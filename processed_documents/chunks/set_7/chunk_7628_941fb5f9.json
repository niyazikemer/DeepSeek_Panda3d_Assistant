If supported by your graphics card, this will reduce texture memory requirements dramatically, to 1/4 or 1/8 of the original. There is some reduction of quality, but not as much as the quality reduction you'd get from downscaling the textures by the equivalent amount. It is also possible to enable texture compression in conjunction with texture scaling.\n\nLimiting graphics memory usage overall\n\nFinally, it may be prudent to limit the amount of graphics memory that Panda attempts to use, with a line like:\n\ngraphics-memory-limit 67108864``",
