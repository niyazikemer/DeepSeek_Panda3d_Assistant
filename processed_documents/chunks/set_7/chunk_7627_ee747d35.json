Panda provides several tools to help with this.\n\nAutomatically reducing textures\n\nYou can reduce textures automatically as they are loaded. The easiest way to do this is to put a line like: texture-scale 0.5 in your Config.prc file. The above example will scale all textures by a factor of 0.5 in each dimension (for an overall reduction to 1/4 of the total memory requirement). If there are certain textures that should not be scaled, for instance GUI textures, you can exclude them with lines like:\n\nexclude-texture-scale digits_*.png\nexclude-texture-scale gui*.jpg\n\nEnabling texture compression",
