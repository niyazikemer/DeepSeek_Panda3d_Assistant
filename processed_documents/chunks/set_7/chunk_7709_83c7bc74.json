If you do not have an IRC client, you can use the web client: https://web.libera.chat/#panda3d\n\nAlthough you will often get a response fairly quickly, depending on the time of day and timezone of our users, it may take longer for people to notice your message and respond. It is recommended that you stay on the channel after asking your question. Asking whether you may ask a question is pointless.",
