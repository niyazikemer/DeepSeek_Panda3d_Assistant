  "content": "By +x face, we mean the face of the cube farthest along the positive X axis. In Panda3D's default Z-up coordinate system, this is the right face. Similarly, the -x face is the face farthest along the negative X axis, or the left face, and so on for the Y and Z faces. Since the coordinates of a texture map are called (u, v, w) instead of (x, y, z), it is technically more correct to call these the +u and -u faces, though it is often easier to think of them as +x and -x.\n\nThe faces are laid out according to the following diagram:\n\nImagine that you cut out the above diagram and folded it into a cube. You'd end up with something like this:",
