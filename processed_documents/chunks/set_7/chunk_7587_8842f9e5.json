  "content": "Bullet FAQ\n\nThis page contains answers to often asked question and elaborations on different topics related to the Bullet Panda3D module.\n\nBullet and Scale\n\nWhen using physics it is always better to avoid scale wherever possible. However, the Bullet module does it's best to support setting scale on RigidBodyNode, GhostNode etc. Shear is not supported at all.\n\nIf you know the dimensions of a Bullet collision shape at the time of creation then create it with those dimensions, and don't use scale to adjust the dimensions afterwards. For example, if you need a box with extents 5x3x1 then create it with these extents, and not with extents 1x1x1 and then scale it with Vec3(5, 3, 1).",
