  "content": "In an orthographic lens, there is no perspective--parallel lines viewed by the lens don't converge; instead, they remain absolutely parallel in the image. While a .PerspectiveLens closely imitates the behavior of a real, physical camera lens, there is no real lens that does what an .OrthographicLens does. An .OrthographicLens, therefore, is most useful for special effects, where you want that unnatural look, or to emulate the so-called 2\u00bd-D look of several popular real-time strategy games, or strictly to render 2-d objects that shouldn't have any perspective anyway. In fact, the default camera created for the render2d scene graph, which is used to draw all of the onscreen GUI elements in Panda, uses an OrthographicLens.",
