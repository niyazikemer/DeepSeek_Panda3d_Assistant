  "content": "Controlling the Camera\n\nDefault Camera Control System\n\nBy default, Panda3D runs a task that allows you to move the camera using the mouse.\n\ncpp\n\nTo enable it, use the following command:\n\nwindow->setup_trackball();\n\nThe keys to navigate are:\n\nMouse Button Action Left Button Pan left and right. Right Button Move forwards and backwards. Middle Button Rotate around the origin of the application. Right and Middle Buttons Roll the point of view around the view axis.\n\nGo ahead and try this camera control system. The problem with it is that it is sometimes awkward. It is not always easy to get the camera pointed in the direction we want.\n\nTasks <tasks>\n\nUpdate the Code\n\nInstead, we are going to write a task that controls the camera's position explicitly. A task is nothing but a procedure that gets called every frame. Update your code as follows:\n\npython\n\ncontrolling-the-camera.py\n\ncpp\n\ncontrolling-the-camera.cxx\n\npython",
