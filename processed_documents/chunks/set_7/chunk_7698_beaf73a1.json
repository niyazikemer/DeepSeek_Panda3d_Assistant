  "content": "The \"-flag\" switch will ensure that panda does not rearrange the geometry for the named polyset, folding it into the model as a whole. It also assigns the polyset a meaningful name. Once you have labeled the relevant piece of geometry, you can obtain a pointer to it using the ~.NodePath.find() method:\n\npython\n\nmyModelsHead = myModel.find(\"**/theHead\")\n\ncpp\n\nNodePath myModelsHead = myModel.find(\"**/theHead\");\n\nWith this NodePath, you can manipulate the head separately from the rest of the model. For example, you can move the piece using ~.NodePath.set_pos(), or change its texture using ~.NodePath.set_texture(), or for that matter, do anything that you would do to any other scene graph node.\n\nUnanimated (environment) models",
