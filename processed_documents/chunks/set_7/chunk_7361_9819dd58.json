  "content": "You can specify the parent nodepath for any DirectGUI object using the parent= argument. You can use base.aspect2d for center-oriented placement, and a2dTopLeft or a2dBottomRight respectively. The Y coordinate should be left 0, because it's useless in the 2D space. The Z coordinate goes from -1 to 1, and X depends on the aspect ratio, by the default 4:3 it's from -1.3333 to 1.3333. The other aspect2d variants don't scale the numbers, just offset them.\n\nThe direct-gui-edit option in the Config.prc file allows the user to use the middle mouse button to move around widgets, and resize them while holding the control key; this is very useful to lay a screen out during development. If you need to turn this ability off for an individual object, set its enableEdit keyword parameter to False.\n\nAll of the DirectGui objects are constructed in a similar way:\n\nfrom direct.gui.DirectGui import *\nmyObject = Directxxxxxx(keyword=value, keyword=value, ...)",
