  "content": "So to print out the positions of the mice, use this:\n\npython\n\nfor mouse in base.pointerWatcherNodes:\n  print(\"NAME=\", mouse.getName())\n  print(\"X=\", mouse.getMouseX())\n  print(\"Y=\", mouse.getMouseY())\n\nEach mouse will have a name-string, which might be something along the lines of \"Micrologic High-Precision Gaming Mouse 2.0 #20245/405\". The name is the only way to tell the various mice apart. If you have two different mice of different brands, you can easily tell them apart by the names. If you have two mice of the same make and manufacture, then their names will be very similar, but still unique. This is not because the mice contain serial numbers, but rather because they are uniquefied based on the USB port into which they are plugged. That means that if you move a mouse from one USB port to another, it will have a new name. For all practical purposes, that means that you will need to store a config file that maps mouse name to intended purpose.",
