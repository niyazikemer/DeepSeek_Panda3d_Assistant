  "content": "Distributing Panda3D Applications\n\npython\n\nStarting with Panda3D 1.10.0, Panda3D provides new tools that make it easy to compile Python applications using Panda3D into a self-contained executable file, which can then be hosted on a website or store front for distribution to end-users.\n\nThese tools are unique among packaging tools in that they will automatically produce binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS. You do not need to own those systems in order to compile a binary for them. In the future, we will extend this list as we add support for more platforms.\n\nFurthermore, they are able to automatically pull in a special optimized version of Panda3D that is lighter and faster than the builds on the website, since they are built without debugging aids and error messages enabled. Building Panda3D from source code is therefore not necessary to create an optimized build.",
