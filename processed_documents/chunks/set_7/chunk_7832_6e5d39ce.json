  "content": "Multiview Textures\n\nAny Panda texture, including a cube map or video texture, can also be loaded as a multiview texture. This means that there are multiple different images, or views, stored within the texture object.\n\nThe most common use for a multiview texture is to implement a stereo texture, or a texture with two views: one for each of the left and the right eyes. For instance, you would do this to project a 3-D movie onto a screen in your virtual space.\n\nIn its default configuration, whenever Panda renders to a 3-D stereo window (see stereo-display-regions), any multiview textures are automatically treated as stereo textures. View 0 is presented to the left eye, and view 1 is presented to the right eye. Additional views beyond view 1 are not used.",
