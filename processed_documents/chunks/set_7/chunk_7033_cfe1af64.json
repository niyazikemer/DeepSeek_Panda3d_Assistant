They are also called \"bump maps.\" Unlike most maps, normal maps do not affect the color of the model - they affect the lighting. When light hits a normal-mapped model, the light creates highlights and shadows throughout those ridges and bumps. If no lights are applied to the model, then there will be no shadows or highlights, and the normal map will be invisible. Currently, Panda3D only allows one normal map per polygon, additional normal maps will be ignored.\n\npython\n\nts = TextureStage('ts')\nts.setMode(TextureStage.MNormal)\nsmiley.setTexture(ts, tex)\n\ncpp",
