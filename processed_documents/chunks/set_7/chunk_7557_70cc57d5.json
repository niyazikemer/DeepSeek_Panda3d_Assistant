  "content": "Creating the GeomPrimitive objects\n\nNow that you have a geomvertexdata with a set of vertices, you can create one or more geomprimitive objects that use the vertices in your GeomVertexData.\n\nIn general, you do this by first creating a GeomPrimitive of the appropriate type, and then calling ~.GeomPrimitive.add_vertex() for each vertex in your primitive, followed by ~.GeomPrimitive.close_primitive() after each primitive is complete. You can contain as many primitives as you like to the same GeomPrimitive object; this is more efficient than creating many separate GeomPrimitive objects.",
