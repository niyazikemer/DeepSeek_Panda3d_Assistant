This may be a little more work than the onscreentext or directlabel objects, but it gives you a lot more control over the appearance of the text.\n\ncpp\n\nRendering text in Panda3D is done using the .TextNode interface.\n\nTo use a TextNode, simply create one and call ~.TextNode.set_text() to set the actual text to display, and then parent the TextNode wherever you like (you can put it under ~builtins.aspect2d to make a 2-d onscreen text, or you can put it in the 3-d world for in-the-world text). Note that if you parent the text to render2d or aspect2d, you will probably need to give it a fairly small scale, since the coordinate space of the whole screen in render2d is in the range (-1, 1).\n\npython",
