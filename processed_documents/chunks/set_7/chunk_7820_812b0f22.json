  "content": "Rendering Text\n\npython\n\nOnscreenText\n\n~.direct.gui.OnscreenText.OnscreenText is a convenience class that is used a quick way to put text onscreen without having to go through the trouble of creating a TextNode and setting properties on it. However, it doesn't have the full range of rendering options that you can get with TextNode directly; and it doesn't support the DirectGUI features of a directlabel. Use an OnscreenText whenever you want a quick way to display some ordinary text without a lot of fancy requirements.\n\nfrom direct.gui.OnscreenText import OnscreenText\ntextObject = OnscreenText(text='my text string', pos=(-0.5, 0.02), scale=0.07)\n\nThe OnscreenText object inherits from NodePath, so all of the standard NodePath operations can be used on the text object. When you are ready to take the text away, use:\n\ntextObject.destroy()\n\nA full list of arguments that can be passed to the constructor is available on the ~.direct.gui.OnscreenText.OnscreenText page of the API reference.",
