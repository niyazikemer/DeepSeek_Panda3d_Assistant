  "content": "The server does all the work of analyzing the data after that. The client's next job is simply to clear its array and prepare itself for the next frame.\n\nThe PStats Server\n\nThe generic server code is in pandatool/src/pstatserver, and the GUI-specific server code is in pandatool/src/gtk-stats and pandatool/src/win-stats, for Unix and Windows, respectively. (There is also an OS-independent text-stats subdirectory, which builds a trivial PStats server that presents a scrolling-text interface. This is mainly useful as a proof of technology rather than as a usable tool.)\n\nThe GUI-specific code is the part that manages the interaction with the user via the creation of windows and the handling of mouse input, etc.; most of the real work of interpreting the data is done in the generic code in the pstatserver directory.",
