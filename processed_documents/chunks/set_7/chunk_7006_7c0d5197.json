The former method will tell you how many Geoms are actually being sent to the graphics card, whereas the latter will count all the Geoms that exist in this part of the scene graph, even those that are out of view.\n\nStatic Objects\n\nIf a scene is composed of many static objects, for example boxes, and the intent of all of these boxes to just sit around and be part of the background, or to move as a single unit, they can flattened together into a handful of nodes (or even one node). To do this, parent them all to the same node, and use:\n\npython\n\nnode.flattenStrong()\n\ncpp\n\nnode.flatten_strong();",
