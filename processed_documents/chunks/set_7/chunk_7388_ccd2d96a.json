  "content": "CollisionParabola\n\nA parabola is another variant on the CollisionRay that bends. It is useful when you want to test with arcs, such as a cannonball shot.\n\nCollisionBox\n\nFinally, a box represents a cuboid. It consists of three pairs of rectangles, with adjacent sides meeting each other at a right angle. This can be employed where ever a necessity arises for using six intersecting planes. A box can be both a 'from' and 'into' object for the shapes specified in the chart. A box can only be constructed as an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB). That is, each side of the box is parallel to one of the coordinate axes. Once constructed, all collision tests are performed on the box as though it was an Oriented-Bounding Box (OBB).\n\nThere are two constructors for the Box. One of them specifies the center for the box as well as the distance of each of the sides from the center.\n\nbox = CollisionBox(center, dx, dy, dz)",
