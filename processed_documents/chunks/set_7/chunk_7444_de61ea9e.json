However, if you use them on an image that doesn't have an alpha channel you will cause a crash. To see if an image has an alpha channel use ~.PNMImage.has_alpha() which returns True if there is an alpha channel and False otherwise. You can add an alpha channel using ~.PNMImage.add_alpha(). You can also remove it using ~.PNMImage.remove_alpha().",
