  "content": "There are two Config.prc variables that determine the graphics pipe or pipes that will be available to an application:\n\nNote that the name specified to each of the above variables, e.g. pandagl, actually names a Windows DLL or Unix shared-library file. Panda3D will put \"lib\" in front of the name and \".dll\" or \".so\" (according to the operating system) after the name, and then attempts to import that library. This means that \"load-display pandagl\" really means to try to import the file \"libpandagl.dll\". The various display DLL's are written so that when they are successfully imported, they will register support for the kind of GraphicsPipe they implement.",
