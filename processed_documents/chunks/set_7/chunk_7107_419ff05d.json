  "content": "DirectButton\n\nDirectButton is a DirectGui object that will respond to the mouse and can execute an arbitrary function when the user clicks on the object. This is actually implemented by taking advantage of the \"state\" system supported by every DirectGui object.\n\nEach DirectGui object has a predefined number of available \"states\", and a current state. This concept of \"state\" is completely unrelated to Panda's FSM <finite-state-machines> object. For a DirectGui object, the current state is simply as an integer number, which is used to select one of a list of different NodePaths that represent the way the DirectGui object appears in each state. Each DirectGui object can therefore have a completely different appearance in each of its states.",
