  "content": "Note that the piano roll chart shows time spent within the frame on the horizontal axis, instead of the vertical axis, as it is on the strip charts. Thus, the guide bars on the piano roll chart are vertical lines instead of horizontal lines, and they may be dragged in from the left or the right sides (instead of from the top or bottom, as on the strip charts). Apart from this detail, these are the same guide bars that appear on the strip charts.\n\nThe piano roll chart may be created from the Graphs pulldown menu.\n\nAdditional threads\n\nIf the panda client has multiple threads that generate PStats data, the PStats server can open up graphs for these threads as well. Each separate thread is considered unrelated to the main thread, and may have the same or an independent frame rate. Each separate thread will be given its own pulldown menu to create graphs associated with that thread; these auxiliary thread menus will appear on the menu bar following the Graphs menu.",
