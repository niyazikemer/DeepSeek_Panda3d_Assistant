  "content": "Time accumulated towards any collector is also counted towards that collector's parent, as defined in the collector's constructor (described above).\n\nIt is important to understand the difference between collectors nested implicitly by runtime start/stop invocations, and the static hierarchy implicit in the collector definition. Time is accumulated in parent collectors according to the statically-defined parents of the innermost active collector only, without regard to the runtime stack of paused collectors.",
