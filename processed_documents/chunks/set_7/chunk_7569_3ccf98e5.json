  "content": "Texture Wrap Modes\n\nAs described earlier, the (u, v) texture coordinates that you assign to your vertices are what determines how the texture fits on your geometry. Often, you will use texture coordinates that always fall within the range [0, 1], which is the complete range of the pixels of your texture image. However, it is also legal to use texture coordinates that go outside this range; you can have negative values, for instance, or numbers higher than 1.\n\nSo if the texture image is only defined over the range [0, 1], what does the texture look like outside this range? You can specify this with the texture wrap mode.\n\npython\n\ntexture.setWrapU(wrap_mode)\ntexture.setWrapV(wrap_mode)\n\ncpp\n\ntexture->set_wrap_u(wrap_mode);\ntexture->set_wrap_w(wrap_mode);\n\nThe wrap_mode parameter is specified separately for the u and v directions (there is also a .Texture.set_wrap_w() for 3-D textures <3d-textures>, but that's an advanced topic). The wrap mode may be any of the following values:",
