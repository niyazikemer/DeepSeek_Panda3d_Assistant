  "content": "Low-Level Render to Texture\n\nRender to Texture Basics\n\nIn Panda3D, rendering to a texture consists of three basic steps:\n\nCreate a hidden window (class .GraphicsBuffer).\n\nRender into the hidden window.\n\nTransfer the contents of the hidden window into a texture.\n\nWhen I say \"transfer\" the contents of a window into a texture, I don't necessarily mean \"copy.\" There are other ways to transfer the contents of a window into a texture that may be faster. For example, if the OpenGL implementation supports the ARB_pbuffers extension, then the transfer might be achieved using wglBindTexImageARB. The Panda user does not need to worry about how the transfer is done. It is only important that you know that Panda will use the fastest means available to transfer the contents of the window into the texture.",
