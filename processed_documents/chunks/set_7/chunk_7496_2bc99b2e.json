  "content": "The PStatServer owns all of the connections, and uses network sockets to communicate with the clients. It listens on the specified port for new connections, using the pstats-port Config.prc variable to determine the port number (this is the same variable that specifies the port to the client). Usually you can leave this at its default value of 5185, but there may be some cases in which that port is already in use on a particular machine (for instance, maybe someone else is running another PStats server on another display of the same machine).\n\nOnce a connection is received, it creates a PStatMonitor class (this class is specialized for each of the different GUI variants) that handles all the data for this particular connection. In the case of the windows pstats.exe program, each new monitor instance is represented by a new toplevel window. Multiple monitors can be active at once.",
