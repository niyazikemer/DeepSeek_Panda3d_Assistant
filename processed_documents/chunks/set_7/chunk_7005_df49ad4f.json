  "content": "Too Many Meshes\n\nIf a scene needs to be rendered and has multiple nodes, Panda has to send each node to the graphics hardware as a separate batch of polygons (because the nodes might move independently, or have different state changes on them). Modern graphics hardware hasn't made any improvements recently in handling large numbers of batches, just in handling large numbers of polygons per batch. So if a scene is composed of a large number of nodes with a small number of polygons per node, the frame rate will suffer. This problem is not specific to Panda; any graphics engine will have the same problem. The problem is due to the nature of the PC and the AGP bus.\n\nFor example, though your graphics card may claim it can easily handle a million polygons, this may be true in practice only if all of those polygons are sent in one batch--that is, just a single geom. If, however, your scene consists of 1,000 nodes with 1,000 polygons each, it may not have nearly as good a frame rate.",
