This is useful for simulating the user experience on older computers with slower hard drives. Set it to a value like 0.1 and you should see the textures pop in as you move around the scene.\n\nYou can use .DisplayRegion.set_texture_reload_priority() if you want ensure that textures in some scenes are loaded with higher priority than other scenes.\n\nAnimation loading",
