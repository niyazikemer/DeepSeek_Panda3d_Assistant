  "content": "If you are using one of these older versions of Blender, however, this plug-in may still be useful to you:\n\nhttps://github.com/09th/YABEE\n\nCaution\n\nThere are some community-made ports of YABEE for newer versions of Blender floating around the internet. These ports are not officially supported as they are often tailored to the author's own purposes and may not produce the expected output in the general case.\n\nMaterial Set-Up\n\nBlender 2.80 (and higher) uses a node graph to define materials. This is a very flexible way to define materials, but export formats are very rigid in how they like their materials to be structured. Therefore, the exporter contains code to recognize particular combinations of material nodes and map them to the more rigidly-defined material slots of the export format.",
