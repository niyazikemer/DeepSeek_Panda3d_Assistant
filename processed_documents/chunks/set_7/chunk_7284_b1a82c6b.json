  "content": "PNMImage pnm_image;\npnm_image.read(Filename(\"models/elevation.png\"));\n\nPT(BulletHeightfieldShape) heightfield_shape = new BulletHeightfieldShape(*pnm_image, height);\n\nThe heightfield shape will be oriented the same way as a GeoMipTerrain created from the same image, but GeoMipTerrain and BulletHeightfieldShape have different origins. The BulletHeightfieldShape is centered around the origin, while the GeoMipTerrain uses the lower left corner as its origin. However, this can be easily corrected by positioning the GeoMipTerrain with an offset relative to the static rigid body node.\n\nIf you are using ShaderTerrainMesh, then you need to use a Texture object as a height map. This will ensure that the shape of the physical body corresponds to the visible geometry.\n\npython",
