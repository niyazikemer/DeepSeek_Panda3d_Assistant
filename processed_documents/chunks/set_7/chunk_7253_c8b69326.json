  "content": "This is effectively the same as \"absolute\" mode, but you can be assured the mouse will remain within the window as long as the mode is in effect and the window remains open.\n\nThe mouse will report events continuously, but it will stick to the edges of the window. So, for a game, this is probably still not desirable.\n\nTo accommodate this, you can schedule a Task to fetch the current mouse position, manually re-center the mouse afterward, and otherwise behave as if the mouse events were generated by the relative mode.\n\nFor example:\n\npython\n\nmw = base.mouseWatcherNode\n\nif mw.hasMouse():\n    # get the position, which at center is (0, 0)\n    x, y = mw.getMouseX(), mw.getMouseY()\n\n    # move mouse back to center\n    props = base.win.getProperties()\n    base.win.movePointer(0,\n                         props.getXSize() // 2,\n                         props.getYSize() // 2)\n    # now, x and y can be considered relative movements",
