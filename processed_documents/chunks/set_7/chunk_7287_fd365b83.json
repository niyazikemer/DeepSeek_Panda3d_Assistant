  "content": "Common Performance Issues\n\nHere is a list of things that can go wrong, roughly in order from most likely to least likely. Each of these has a section to explain it in greater detail.\n\ntoo-many-meshes. A well-made typical 3D model contains one mesh. Huge 3D models, such as the model of an entire dungeon or an entire island, might contain multiple meshes. 3D models created by inexperienced modelers can contain dozens of meshes. Most video cards can render about 300 meshes total for the entire scene. Panda3D contains tools to coalesce multiple meshes into one, but they aren't fully automatic.\n\ntoo-many-state-changes. The state of an object is the sum of its color, material, light, fog, and other attributes. It can be expensive, for a variety of reasons, to have too many different states in your scene. It is better if many objects share the same state.",
