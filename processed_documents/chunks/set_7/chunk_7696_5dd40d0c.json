  "content": "There are two different ways that you should do this, according to the type of model it is.\n\nAnimated (skeleton animation) models\n\nIf your model is animated via keyframe animation in a package such as 3DSMax or Maya--that is, the sort of model you expect to load in via the Actor <animated-models> interface--then Panda will be aggressive in combining all of the geometry into as few nodes as possible. In order to mark particular geometry to be kept separate, you should use the egg-optchar program.\n\nThe name \"optchar\" is short for \"optimize character\", since the egg-optchar program is designed to optimize an animated character for runtime performance by removing unused and unneeded joints. However, in addition to this optimization, it also allows you to label a section of a model for later manipulation. Once you have labeled a piece of geometry, Panda's optimization mechanisms will not fold it in to the rest of the model.",
