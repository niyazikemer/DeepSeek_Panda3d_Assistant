  "content": "Panda3D uses the \"geographical\" coordinate system where position (-8, 42, 0) means map coordinates (8, 42) and height 0. If you are used to OpenGL/Direct3D coordinates, then hold up your right hand in the classical position with thumb as X, fingers as Y, and palm as Z facing toward you; then tilt backward until your hand is level with the fingers pointing away and palm facing up. Moving \"forward\" in Panda3D is a positive change in Y coordinate.\n\nThe Program\n\nUpdate the Code\n\nWith Panda3D running properly, it is now possible to load some grassy scenery. Update your code as follows:\n\npython\n\nloading-the-grassy-scenery.py\n\nThe ShowBase procedure loader.loadModel() <direct.showbase.Loader.Loader.loadModel> loads the specified file, in this case the environment.egg file in the models folder. The return value is an object of the .NodePath class, effectively a pointer to the model. Note that filename-syntax uses the forward-slash, even under Windows.\n\ncpp\n\nloading-the-grassy-scenery.cxx",
