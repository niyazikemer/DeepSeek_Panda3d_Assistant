If it is, it can take the color of the vertex and draw a pixel with this color. If not, the graphic card looks at which triangle this pixel belongs. Then it looks at where the vertices of this triangle are and calculates the distance to each of the vertices. Based on this distance and the color of the vertices, it interpolates all color components and draws a pixel with this color.",
