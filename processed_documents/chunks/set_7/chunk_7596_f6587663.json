  "content": "multify is used to store and extract files from a Panda Multifile. This is similar to a tar or zip file in that it is an archive file that contains a number of subfiles that may later be extracted.\n\nPanda's VirtualFileSystem is capable of mounting Multifiles for direct access to the subfiles contained within without having to extract them out to independent files first.\n\nThe command-line options for multify are designed to be similar to those for tar, the traditional Unix archiver utility.\n\nRead Assets\n\nIf you want to prepare to read assets from a Multifile directly, you can \"mount\" it into the virtual file system:\n\npython\n\nfrom panda3d.core import VirtualFileSystem\nfrom panda3d.core import Multifile\nfrom panda3d.core import Filename\nvfs = VirtualFileSystem.getGlobalPtr()\nvfs.mount(Filename(\"foo.mf\"), \".\", VirtualFileSystem.MFReadOnly)\n\ncpp\n\nVirtualFileSystem *vfs = VirtualFileSystem::get_global_ptr();\nvfs->mount(\"./foo.mf\", \".\", VirtualFileSystem::MF_read_only);",
