  "content": "Collision Solids\n\nThe CollisionSolid is the fundamental object of the collision system. CollisionSolids represent special invisible geometry that is created solely for the purpose of performing collision tests; these CollisionSolids are stored in the scene graph alongside the normal visible geometry.\n\nThe CollisionSolids are specifically optimized for performing collision tests quickly. Collisions can be performed against visible geometry as well, but this is more expensive since visible geometry is not optimized for this sort of thing.\n\nYou can create CollisionSolids interactively in program code, or you can construct them in your modeling package and load them up from an egg or bam file along with the rest of your scene.",
