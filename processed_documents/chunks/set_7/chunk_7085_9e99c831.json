  "content": "The most commonly used metric for performance by gamers is the frame rate, an average of the number of frames that are rendered in a single second (FPS). You can enable a display showing this number in Panda3D by enabling the show-frame-rate-meter setting in the Config.prc <configuring-panda3d> file. However, developers prefer to talk about the reciprocal of this number, the frame time, usually measured in milliseconds. This is because FPS is not a linear scale and therefore gives a distorted view: I have seen developers panic because their frame rate decreased from 1000 FPS to 500 FPS, which seems like a lot, but it represents only a difference of 1 millisecond, which is about the same as reducing your frame rate from 30 to 29 FPS.",
