We could force Panda3D to render a frame after creating the text object, but still, any operation that requires a re-render (such as resizing the window, or alt-tabbing to another application) would cause the window to become black and may even prompt the operating system to warn that the application is not responding.\n\nClearly, this does not provide a good user experience. Therefore, it is recommended that models are loaded in an asynchronous manner, in a separate thread of execution, so that the application can continue rendering while the load operation occurs in the background. Panda3D provides several ways of doing so.\n\npython\n\nLoading with callback",
