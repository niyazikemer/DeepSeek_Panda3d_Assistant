  "content": "Although the local size of a work group is typically relatively small (you can count on 1024 total invocations within a single work group), you may invoke any number of these work groups. The work group count is not hard-coded within the shader, but specified by the application. One common workflow for an image processing shader is to divide up the image into tiles of fixed size, and then to specify in the application how many tiles are in the image to be processed.",
