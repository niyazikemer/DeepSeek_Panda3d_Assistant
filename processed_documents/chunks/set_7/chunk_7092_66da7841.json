  "content": "I cannot emphasize this too much: do not redesign your game, until you are sure that the problem isn't a typo! Imagine how irritated you would be if you wrote an MMO, and then spent six months re-engineering it to make it faster, only to discover that the entire performance problem was an off-by-one error in a minor subroutine.\n\nCatching performance problems that are bugs can be tricky. The place to begin is using the same performance diagnostics that you would use for any other problem. However, you will usually find a red flag somewhere: if the performance monitoring tools say that you're rendering 50,000 models, but you only count 50 models on the screen, you're dealing with a bug. You need to be alert enough not to discount such red flags. If you see a stat that looks suspicious, don't assume that the performance monitoring tool is telling you the wrong thing ---assume that there's a bug in the code.\n\nTable of Contents",
