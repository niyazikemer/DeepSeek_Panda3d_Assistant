  "content": "loaderOptions may optionally be passed in to control details\n        about the way the model is searched and loaded.  See the\n        `.LoaderOptions` class for more.\n\n        The default is to look in the `.ModelPool` (RAM) cache first,\n        and return a copy from that if the model can be found there.\n        If the bam cache is enabled (via the `model-cache-dir` config\n        variable), then that will be consulted next, and if both\n        caches fail, the file will be loaded from disk.  If noCache is\n        True, then neither cache will be consulted or updated.\n\n        If allowInstance is True, a shared instance may be returned\n        from the `.ModelPool`.  This is dangerous, since it is easy to\n        accidentally modify the shared instance, and invalidate future\n        load attempts of the same model.  Normally, you should leave\n        allowInstance set to False, which will always return a unique\n        copy.",
