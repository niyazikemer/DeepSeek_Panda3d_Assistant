Unfortunately, you cannot tell in a portable way if a given mode is supported; also, since the window properties request is asynchronous, you will not be able to immediately detect if it took effect.\n\nThe way to test this is to check whether your request was honored, after events have been processed, using the TaskManager method ~direct.task.Task.TaskManager.doMethodLater().\n\npython\n\nFor example:\n\ndef setMouseMode(...):\n    ...\n    base.win.requestProperties(props)\n    base.taskMgr.doMethodLater(0, resolveMouse, \"Resolve mouse setting\")\n    ...\n\ndef resolveMouse(task):\n    props = base.win.getProperties()",
