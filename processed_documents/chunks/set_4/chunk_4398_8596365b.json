Consider enabling line or\n              multisample antialiasing for best results.\n\n            TextFont.RMPolygon - Font characters are rendered as a\n              flat polygon.  This works best for very large\n              characters, and generally requires polygon or\n              multisample antialiasing to be enabled for best results.\n\n            TextFont.RMExtruded - Font characters are rendered with a\n              3-D outline made of polygons, like a cookie cutter.\n              This is appropriate for a 3-D scene, but may be\n              completely invisible when assigned to a 2-D scene and\n              viewed normally from the front, since polygons are\n              infinitely thin.",
