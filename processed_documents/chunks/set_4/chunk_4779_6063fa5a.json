  "content": "\"\"\"\nPool is a collection of python objects that you can checkin and\ncheckout. This is useful for a cache of objects that are expensive to load\nand can be reused over and over, like splashes on cannonballs, or\nbulletholes on walls. The pool is unsorted. Items do not have to be unique\nor be the same type.\n\nInternally the pool is implemented with 2 lists, free items and used items.\n\nExample:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        p = Pool([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n        x = p.checkout()\n        p.checkin(x)\n\n\"\"\"\n\n__all__ = ['Pool']\n\n\nfrom direct.directnotify import DirectNotifyGlobal",
