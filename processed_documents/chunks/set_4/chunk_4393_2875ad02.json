If unspecified, it is taken from the\n        font information.  This may be specified for static as well as\n        dynamic fonts.\n\n        The remaining parameters may only be specified for dynamic\n        fonts.\n\n        pixelsPerUnit controls the visual quality of the rendered text\n        characters.  It specifies the number of texture pixels per\n        each Panda unit of character height.  Increasing this number\n        increases the amount of detail that can be represented in the\n        characters, at the expense of texture memory.",
