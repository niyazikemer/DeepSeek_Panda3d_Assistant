  "content": "There are a vast array of rendering effects that can be achieved with different variants on texturing. Before you can learn about them, it is important to understand the basics of texturing first.\n\nIn simple texturing--by far the most common form--you can think of the texture map as a layer of paint that is applied to the model. In order for the graphics hardware to know in what direction the paint should be applied, the model must have been created with texture coordinates--a special (u, v) coordinate pair that is associated with each vertex of your model. Each vertex's (u, v) texture coordinates place the vertex at a particular point within the texture map, in the same way that the vertex's (x, y, z) coordinates place the vertex at a particular point in 3-D space.",
