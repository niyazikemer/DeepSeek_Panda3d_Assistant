Set this to -1 to allow any number of joints. egg-vertex-membership-quantize double 0.1 Specifies the nearest amount to round each vertex joint membership\nvalue when loading an egg file. This affects animated egg files only.\nThere is a substantial runtime performance advantage for reducing\ntrivial differences in joint membership. Set this to 0 to leave joint\nmembership as it is. enforce-attrib-lock bool 1 When a MaterialAttrib, TextureAttrib, or LightAttrib is constructed,\nthe corresponding Material, Texture, or Light is 'attrib locked.' The\nattrib lock prevents qualitative changes to the object. This makes it\npossible to hardwire information about material, light, and texture\nproperties into generated shaders. This config variable can disable the\nattrib lock. Disabling the lock will break the shader generator, but",
