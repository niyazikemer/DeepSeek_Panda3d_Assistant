If you want to use the provided binaries you can use this version, but 2017, 2019 or 2022 will work as well.\n\nIf you wish to use another version you will have to build Panda from source. Note that if you do that you will need all the dependencies (such us libjpeg, libpng, etc) built by the same compiler than you are using. You can do this yourself or look around for third-party binaries.\n\nOn UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux and macOS, you can use the LLVM Clang or GNU G++ compiler.\n\nNote",
