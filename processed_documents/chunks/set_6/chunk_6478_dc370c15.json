  "content": "Removing Custom Class Instances\n\nThe following text was taken from the Panda3D 1.6 Game Engine Beginner's Guide available from Packt Publishing with the author's permission. The text refers to a \"custom class\", which is a python class that is not part of the Panda3D SDK. Here is an example of a custom class:\n\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        myVar1 = 10\n        myVar2 = 20\n    def myMethod(self):\n        return (self.myVar1, self.myVar2)\n\nFrom Panda3D 1.6 Game Engine Beginner's Guide:\n\nPython will automatically garbage collect a custom class instance when all the references to that instance are removed. In theory, this makes garbage collection as simple as cleaning up those references, but because there are so many different places and reasons for these references garbage collection can quickly grow complicated. Following these steps will help to ensure that a custom class instance is properly garbage collected.",
