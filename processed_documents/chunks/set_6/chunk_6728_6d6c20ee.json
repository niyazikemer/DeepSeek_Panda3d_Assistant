If the parabola is smaller than this,\nit will make a BoundingSphere instead, which is much easier to make and\nwill be good enough for small parabolas. color-bits int 1 1 1 (from Config.prc); hardcoded The minimum number of total color buffer bits requested. If you\nspecify only one value, it will represent the total value for the red,\ngreen and blue channels, and indicates you don't care how the bits are\ndivided up among the red, green and blue channels. If you specify three\nvalues, it represents three separate red, green and blue bit",
