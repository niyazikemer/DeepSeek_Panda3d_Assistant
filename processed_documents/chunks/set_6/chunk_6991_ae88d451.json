  "content": "base.oobe()\n\n~direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.oobeCull() is a variant on ~direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.oobe(), and it works similarly, except that it still culls the scene as if the camera were still in its original position, while drawing the scene from the point of view of your camera's new position. So now you can view the scene from your \"out of body\" placement, and walk around, and you can see things popping in and out of view as your view frustum moves around the world.",
