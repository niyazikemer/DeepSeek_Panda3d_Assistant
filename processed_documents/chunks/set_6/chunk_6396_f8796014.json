  "content": "GeomLines\n\nThis kind of GeomPrimitive stores any number of connected or unconnected line segments. It is similar to a GeomTriangles, but it draws lines instead of triangles. Each line has exactly two vertices.\n\nBy default, line segments are one pixel wide, no matter how far away they are from the camera. You can use nodePath.setRenderModeThickness() to change this; if you specify a thickness greater than 1, this will make the lines render as thick lines, the specified number of pixels wide. However, the lines will always be the same width in pixels, regardless of how far away from the camera they are.\n\nThick lines are not supported by the DirectX renderer; in DirectX, the thickness parameter is ignored.\n\nGeomLinestrips",
