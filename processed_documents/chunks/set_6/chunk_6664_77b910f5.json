  "content": "Remember that you must usually choose a power of two <choosing-a-texture-size> for the size of your texture images. This extends to the w size, too: for most graphics cards, the number of slices of your texture should be a power of two. Unlike the ordinary (u, v) dimensions, Panda3D won't automatically rescale your 3-D texture if it has a non-power-of-two size in the w dimension, so it is important that you choose the size correctly yourself.\n\nApplications for 3-D textures\n\n3-D textures are often used in scientific and medical imagery applications, but they are used only rarely in 3-D game programs. One reason for this is the amount of memory they require; since a 3-D texture requires storing (u \u00d7 v \u00d7 w) texels, a large 3-D texture can easily consume a substantial fraction of your available texture memory.",
