To be on the safe side, every class that inherits from DirectObject and will be deleted during run time should call self.ignoreAll() to tell the message system that the class is no longer listening to messages. That will remove the reference.\n\nRemove all direct references to the custom class instance \u2013 Naturally, the custom class instance won\u2019t get cleaned up if something is referencing it directly, either through a circular self reference, or because it was created as a \u201cchild\u201d of another class and that other class has a reference to it stored as a variable. All of these references need to be removed. This also includes references to the custom class instance placed in PythonTags.",
