  "content": "This is very inconvenient. Being able to ask \"where is this object located\" is fundamental. There are other incredibly useful queries that you cannot perform because of instancing. For example, you cannot fetch the parent of a node. You cannot determine its global color, or any other global attribute. All of these queries are ill-defined, because a single node can have many positions, many colors, many parents. Yet these queries are essential. It was therefore necessary for the Panda3D designers to come up with some way to perform these queries, even though a node can be in multiple locations at the same time.\n\nThe solution is based on the following observation: if I had a pointer to the chorus line-dancer model, and I also had a unique identifier that distinguishes one of the 150 instances from all the others, then I could meaningfully ask for the net transform of that particular instance of the node.",
