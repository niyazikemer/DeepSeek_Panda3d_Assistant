Then creating Materials is a matter of creating instances of the .Material class and setting the relevant properties:\n\npython\n\nimport direct.directbase.DirectStart\nfrom panda3d.core import Material\n\nmyMaterial = Material()\nmyMaterial.setShininess(5.0) # Make this material shiny\nmyMaterial.setAmbient((0, 0, 1, 1)) # Make this material blue\n\nmyNode = loader.loadModel(\"panda\") # Load the model to apply the material to\nmyNode.setMaterial(myMaterial) # Apply the material to this nodePath\n\ncpp",
