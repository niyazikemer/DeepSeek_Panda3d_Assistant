  "content": "How the Shader Generator Works\n\nWhen panda goes to render something marked ~.NodePath.set_shader_auto(), it synthesizes a shader to render that object. In order to generate the shader, it examines all the attributes of the object: the lights, the material, the fog setting, the color, the vertex colors... almost everything. It takes into account all of these factors when generating the shader. For instance, if the object has a material attrib, then material color support is inserted into the shader. If the object has lights, then lighting calculations are inserted into the shader. If the object has vertex colors, then the shader is made to use those.\n\nCaching and the Shader Generator",
