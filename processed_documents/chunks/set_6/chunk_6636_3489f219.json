  "content": "Creating Windows and Buffers\n\nAlthough Panda does provide the convenience function base.openWindow() to create a new window, this function does a lot of things automatically for you and therefore takes away a lot of control. The following discussion will focus instead on creating a window using the low-level interface, in order provide a clearer understanding of the actual class relationships.\n\nIn order to create a window, you will first need a .GraphicsEngine and a .GraphicsPipe object. Both of these were discussed in more detail in previous pages. Panda will typically create both of these for you at startup, and store them in base.graphicsEngine and base.pipe, respectively.",
