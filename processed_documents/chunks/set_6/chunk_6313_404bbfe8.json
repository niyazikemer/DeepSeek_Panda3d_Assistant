  "content": "The Rigid Body Combiner\n\nWhen you are developing a complex game, you will most likely run into the problem that you will have too many meshes <too-many-meshes> in your scene. Panda3D's flattening methods can help you reducing the number of nodes, but often when you have hundreds of moving bodies this is not always an option.
