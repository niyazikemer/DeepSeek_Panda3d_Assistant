If\npfm-resize-quick is also true, this only takes effect when the pfm is\nbeing upsampled. This just controls the behavior of resize(); you can\nalways call box_filter() or gaussian_filter() explicitly. pfm-resize-quick bool 1 Specify true to implement PfmFile::resize() with a \"quick\" filter,\nbut only when the pfm is being downsampled (to a smaller size).
