Unlike keyboard button events, each device will send its button events with a specific prefix. These prefixes need to be set by the developer when a device is attached for usage, which can be done with a call to self.attachInputDevice(device, prefix=\"[your-prefix]\"). The device that needs to be passed to this function can be obtained using self.devices.get_devices() <.InputDeviceManager.get_devices>, which will give you all devices of a given device class. After the device has been attached, you can catch events like for example, \"[prefix]-face_a\" which will be thrown whenever the 'A' button on the device with the specified prefix is hit. As with keyboard support, there also is the '-up' postfix which can be added to catch the event which will be thrown when a previously pressed button is released again. Note, if a button with an to the engine unknown code was pressed,",
