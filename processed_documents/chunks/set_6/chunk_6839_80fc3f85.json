If this is false, you must\nexplicitly enable motion detection for a particular traverser. It is\nfalse by default to force programmers to decide on a case-by-case basis\nwhether they really need this feature. restore-initial-pose bool 1 When this is true, setting all control effects on an Actor to 0\ncauses it to return to its default, unanimated pose.
