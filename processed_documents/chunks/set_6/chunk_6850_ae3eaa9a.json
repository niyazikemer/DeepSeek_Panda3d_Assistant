Without this enabled, offscreen renders\nwill be copied to a texture instead of directly rendered there. support-rescale-normal bool 1 Set this true to allow use of the rescale-normal feature, if it is\nsupported by your graphics card. This allows lighting normals to be\nuniformly counter-scaled, instead of re-normalized, in the presence of a\nuniform scale, which should in principle be a bit faster. This feature\nis only supported by the OpenGL API. support-stencil bool 1 Set this true to allow use of the stencil buffer, if it is supported\nby your graphics card. If this is false, stencil buffer support will not\nbe enabled, even if it is supported. Generally, only very old cards do\nnot support some kind of stencil buffer operations; but it is also not\nsupported by our tinydisplay renderer. The main reason to set this false",
