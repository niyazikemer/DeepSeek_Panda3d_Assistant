If this parameter is zero, the StencilAttrib is not processed. Next is the comparison function this attribute uses, in this case Equal. The next three parameters determine what happens to the stencil buffer depending on the result of the comparison. We'll get to these in a minute. The three Keep values tell this attribute never to modify the values in the buffer. Next is the reference value for the comparison function. Before the reference value is passed to the comparison function, however, it is bitwise ANDed with a mask. In our case, we're interested in reading but not in writing to the stencil buffer, so we pass 1 and 0 for the read and write masks, respectively. These masks are the last two parameters for the StencilAttrib.",
