  "content": "The Shader Generator\n\nAs of version 1.5.0, panda supports several new features:\n\nper-pixel lighting\n\nnormal mapping\n\ngloss mapping\n\nglow mapping\n\nhigh-dynamic range rendering\n\ncartoon shading\n\nIt's not that these things weren't possible before: they were. But previously, you had to write shaders to accomplish these things. This is no longer necessary. As of version 1.5.0, all that has to happen is for the artist to apply a normal map, gloss map, or glow map in the 3D modeling program. Then, the programmer gives permission for shader generation, and Panda3D handles the rest.\n\nA few of these features do require minimal involvement from the programmer: for instance, high-dynamic range rendering requires the programmer to choose a tone-mapping operator from a small set of options. But that's it: the amount of work required of the programmer is vastly less than before.",
