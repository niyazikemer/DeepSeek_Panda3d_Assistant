  "content": "Render-to-texture is particularly useful when you'd like to apply a \"filter\" to your scene. If you've ever used Photoshop, you know what a filter is: Photoshop has lots of interesting filters that do blurring, texturizing, edge detection, and more. The first step in implementing a filter is to render the entire scene into a texture. Then, the texture is applied to a full-screen quad and displayed in a window. So far, it looks the same as if you simply rendered the scene into the window. However, by applying a shader to the full-screen quad, you can implement your filter.\n\nThere are several other interesting uses for render-to-texture: water reflections, environment mapping, creating virtual televisions, shadow mapping... the list is quite long.\n\nThe Low-Level API and the High-Level Utilities",
