  "content": "Many of these features are complementary with image postprocessing operations <common-image-filters>, some of which are now nearly-automatic as well. For example, HDR combines very nicely with the bloom filter, and cartoon shading goes very well with cartoon inking.\n\nIndividually, these features are not documented in this chapter of the manual. Instead, they're documented in the portion of the manual where they make the most sense. For example, normal mapping, gloss mapping, and glow mapping are all documented in the section on texturing. HDR and cartoon shading are documented under Render Attributes in the subsection on light-ramps.\n\nHowever, to enable any of these features, you need to tell Panda3D that it's OK to automatically generate shaders and send them to the video card. The call to do this is:\n\npython\n\nnodepath.setShaderAuto()\n\ncpp\n\nnodepath.set_shader_auto();",
