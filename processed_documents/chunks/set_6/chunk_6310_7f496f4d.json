To save space, the graphical tool does not have access to all of the features of the exporter. It is designed for rapid verification of assets. The features you can execute with the graphical tool are identical to the respective ones of the command line exporter listed below.\n\nOr, you can integrate the UI interface to Maya. There is a very convenient way to launch the MayaPandaTool, using Maya shelf to store the MEL script:\n\nOpen the Script Editor (Window > General Editors > Script Editor)\n\nIn Script Editor, load the MayaPandaTool MEL script (File > Open Script)\n\nselect the MEL text (press Ctrl+A)\n\nusing middle mouse button, drag the selected text onto the shelf\n\n(optional) Using Shelf Editor, you can change the image of Panda exporter icon to distinguish it from the others:\n\nAnytime you need to open the Panda Exporter, just click the icon on the shelf.\n\nFor Windows users:",
