Their velocity is dependent on their spawn location within the sphere. It is 0 at the center, of magnitude 1 at the outer edge of the sphere, and linearly interpolated in between.\n\nTangentRingEmitter\n\nVariable Definition Values radius Radius of ring [0, infinity)\n\nCustom mode emits particles tangentially to the ring edge, with a velocity magnitude of 1.",
