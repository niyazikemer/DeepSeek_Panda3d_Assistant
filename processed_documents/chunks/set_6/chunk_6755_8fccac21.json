In fact, the egg\nloader will generate simple texture images if either this or\npreload-simple-textures is true. egg-recursion-limit int 1000 The maximum number of levels that recursive algorithms within the\negg library are allowed to traverse. This is a simple hack to prevent\ndeeply-recursive algorithms from triggering a stack overflow. Set it\nlarger to run more efficiently if your stack allows it; set it lower if\nyou experience stack overflows. egg-retesselate-coplanar bool 0 If this is true, the egg loader may reverse the tesselation\ndirection of a single pair of planar triangles that share the same\nproperties, if that will help get a better triangle strip. In some rare\ncases, doing so can distort the UV's on a face; turning this off should\neliminate that artifact (at the cost of less-effective triangle",
