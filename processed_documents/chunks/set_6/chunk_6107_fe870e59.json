  "content": "DirectSlider\n\nUse a DirectSlider to make a slider, a widget that allows the user to select a value between a bounded interval.\n\nA DirectSlider consists of a long bar, by default horizontal, along with a \"thumb\", which is a special button that the user may move left or right along the bar. The normal DirectGui parameters such as frameSize, geom, and relief control the look of the bar; to control the look of the thumb, prefix each of these parameters with the prefix \"thumb_\", e.g. thumb_frameSize.\n\nIf you want to get (or modify) the current value of the slider (by default, the range is between 0 and 1), use mySlider['value'].",
