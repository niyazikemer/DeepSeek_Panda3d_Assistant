  "content": "Introducing Graphics Classes\n\nGraphicsEngine\n\nThe .GraphicsEngine is where it all begins. There is only one, global, GraphicsEngine in an application, and its job is to keep all of the pointers to your open windows and buffers, and also to manage the task of doing the rendering, for all of the open windows and buffers. Panda normally creates a GraphicsEngine for you at startup, which is available as base.graphicsEngine. There is usually no reason to create a second GraphicsEngine.\n\nGraphicsPipe\n\nEach application will also need at least one .GraphicsPipe. The GraphicsPipe encapsulates the particular API used to do rendering. For instance, there is one GraphicsPipe class for OpenGL rendering, and a different GraphicsPipe for DirectX. Although it is possible to create a GraphicsPipe of a specific type directly, normally Panda will create a default GraphicsPipe for you at startup, which is available in base.pipe.",
