But using an FSM can make it easier. In this simple model, you could define an FSM with two states, \"Walk\" and \"Swim\". This might be represented graphically like this:\n\ntransitions\n\nrankdir=LR node [style=rounded, shape=box]\n\nWalk -> Swim; Swim -> Walk;\n\nTo implement this as a Panda3D FSM, you would declare an new class that inherits from FSM, and within this class you would define four methods: enterWalk(), exitWalk(), enterSwim(), and exitSwim(). This might look something like this:\n\nfrom direct.fsm.FSM import FSM",
