  "content": "Collision System Misuse\n\nThe collision system can detect most types of collisions very rapidly. However, it is possible to construct situations that the collision detection system just can't handle. This page lists a few of these things, and how to improve them.\n\nColliding with Visible Geometry\n\nPanda3D supports calculating collisions against visible scene geometry. However, this method is not at all efficient. It is far more efficient to construct specific collision-solids to represent the various objects in the scene. Even collision geometry constructed from .CollisionPolygon objects is significantly more efficient than colliding against the renderable geometry!\n\nVarious exporters are able to automatically generate optimized collision geometry during the export process. Consult the documentation for your exporter to find out how to do this.",
