Use the ~.NodePath.set_occluder() method on any NodePath to make the occluder active on that NodePath and its children. It is much more efficient to call ~.NodePath.set_occluder() on a parent node with children as opposed to calling ~.NodePath.set_occluder() on many different nodes.\n\nOccluder Configuration",
