  "content": "What if I already have a copy of Python?\n\nIf you already have a copy of Python, and you wish to use that instead of the one provided with Panda3D, it is easy to do so. Simply create a \"panda.pth\" file inside your copy of Python, containing the path of the panda directory and the bin directory within it on separate lines (for example C:\\Panda3D-|release|-x64 and C:\\Panda3D-|release|-x64\\bin). This will enable your copy of Python to find the Panda3D libraries.\n\nFor this to work, the version of Python that you use must match the version of Python included with Panda3D. The Panda3D libraries are compiled for that particular version, and will not work with any other.\n\nOf course, if you do use your own copy of Python, you may wish to delete Panda3D's copy of Python, or at least, remove it from the PATH environment variable. Otherwise, you will have two copies of Python, which can lead to confusion.\n\nPython Programming Resources",
