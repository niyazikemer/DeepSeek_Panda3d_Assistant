You must have already exposed the joint before this call, either with the egg- optchar command line tool, or by calling actor.exposeJoint() <direct.actor.Actor.Actor.exposeJoint> at runtime.\n\nAfter calling ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.attach(), the stacked part will inherit the animation from the attachment joint, by virtue of the scene graph relationship.\n\nAnimation\n\nYou can animate the parts as normal animations, but you need to supply the partname, like this:\n\nmyactor.play('Animation Name', 'Part Name')",
