When not in blend mode, actor.stop() will always stop whatever animation is currently playing, regardless of the animation name you specify.\n\nWhen you are done using blending and want to return to the normal mode of only playing one animation at a time, call disableBlend():\n\npython\n\nactor.disableBlend()\n\nHalf-body animation\n\nIf you want different parts of your actor to play separate animations without blending them together you have to create subparts. Each of these can then play one animation without influencing the others. Call actor.makeSubpart() <direct.actor.Actor.Actor.makeSubpart> with the desired name, a list of joints to be included and a list of joints to be excluded in the subpart. Inclusion / exclusion will descend attached joints. Exclude always overrides include.",
