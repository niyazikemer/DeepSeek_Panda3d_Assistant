Type is either \"axis\" or \"point\", describing the type of rotation.\n\nBillboards rotate about their local axis. In the case of a Y-up file, the billboards rotate about the Y axis; in a Z-up file, they rotate about the Z axis. Point-rotation billboards rotate about the origin.\n\nThere is an implicit <Instance> around billboard geometry. This means that the geometry within a billboard is not specified in world coordinates, but in the local billboard space. Thus, a vertex drawn at point 0,0,0 will appear to be at the pivot point of the billboard, not at the origin of the scene.\n\nSwitchCondition\n\n\u00a0 <SwitchCondition>\u00a0{\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Distance>\u00a0{\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0out\u00a0[fade]\u00a0<Vertex>\u00a0{\u00a0x\u00a0y\u00a0z\u00a0}\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0}\n\u00a0 }",
