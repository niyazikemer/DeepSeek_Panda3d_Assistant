  "content": "In this image, the camera indicated with \"C\" is the center view, the normal view from the center of the camera view in the case of Lens.SC_mono. \"L\" and \"R\" represent the left and right points of view for the same camera, which will be used in the case of Lens.SC_left or Lens.SC_right. The distance between these two eyes, line \"a\" on the image, is the interocular distance, which should be in the same units as the scene you are viewing.\n\nThe gray lines on the image represent the direction the camera appears to be facing into the scene. Both the left and the right eyes converge together at one point, which is the convergence distance. This distance is represented by line \"b\" on the image. Generally, the objects that are this distance away will appear to be in the screen plane. Objects that are closer than the convergence distance will appear to float in front of the screen, while objects that are further than the convergence distance will appear to be inside the screen.",
