It can be used for a patrolling type of behavior.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIDyzUJgu2w\n\nIn PandAI, path follow is defined as :\n\naiBehaviors.pathFollow(float priority)\naiBehaviors.addToPath(Vec3 position)\n\naiBehaviors.startFollow() // Required to start the follow\n\nPosition is a point in 3D space which falls on the path which the AI Character needs to traverse.\n\n(Note: that you need to add multiple positions to create a path say for example Vec3(-10,10,0) Vec3(0,0,0) Vec3(10,10,0) Vec3(-10,10,0) will generate a rectangular path in the XY plane)\n\nNote: the addToPath works backwards. So, your last call to addToPath will be your first position your AICharacter will go to.\n\nThe full working code in Panda3D is :",
