To run your program, enter the following in a terminal (command prompt):\n\nppython filename.py\n\nTo run it on GNU/Linux or macOS, enter the following in a terminal:\n\npython filename.py\n\nIf Panda3D has been installed properly, a grey window titled Panda appears. There is nothing we can do with this window, but that will change shortly.\n\ncpp\n\nCreating a New Panda3D Application\n\nTo start Panda3D, create a text file and save it with a .cxx extension. Any text editor will work. Enter the following text into your C++ file:\n\n#include \"pandaFramework.h\"\n#include \"pandaSystem.h\"\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n  // Open a new window framework\n  PandaFramework framework;\n  framework.open_framework(argc, argv);\n\n  // Set the window title and open the window\n  framework.set_window_title(\"My Panda3D Window\");\n  WindowFramework *window = framework.open_window();\n\n  // Here is room for your own code",
