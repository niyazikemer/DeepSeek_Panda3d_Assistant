  "content": "Note that the second triangle in a triangle strip is defined in clockwise order, the third triangle is in counterclockwise order, the fourth triangle is in clockwise order again, and so on.\n\nOn certain hardware, particularly older SGI hardware and some console games, using triangle strips is an important optimization to reduce the number of vertices that are sent to the graphics pipe, since most triangles (except for the first one) can be defined with only a single vertex, rather than three vertices for each triangle.\n\nModern PC graphics cards prefer to receive a group of triangle strips connected together into one very long triangle strip, by the introduction of repeated vertices and degenerate triangles. Panda will do this automatically, but in order for this to work you should ensure that every triangle strip has an even number of vertices in it.",
