  "content": "Particle Emitters\n\nThere are a large number of particle emitters, each categorized by the volume of space they represent. Additionally, all emitters have three modes: explicit, radiate, and custom. Explicit mode emits the particles in parallel in the same direction. Radiate mode emits particles away from a specific point. Custom mode emits particles with a velocity determined by the particular emitter. All emitters have a number of common parameters.\n\nVariable Definition Values emissionType Emission mode ET_EXPLICIT, ET_RADIATE, ET_CUSTOM explicitLaunchVector Initial velocity in explicit mode (x, y, z) radiateOrigin Point particles launch away from in radiate mode (x, y, z) amplitude Launch velocity multiplier (-infinity, infinity) amplitudeSpeed Spread for launch velocity multiplier [0, infinity)\n\nThe following list contains the different types of emitters, their unique parameters, and the effect of the custom mode.\n\nBoxEmitter",
