This should list all of the dependencies that are packaged along with the application, including Panda3D itself. Third-party dependencies available via pip are therefore supported, as long as they provide wheel files for the different supported platforms (as the vast majority of packages do).\n\nExample\n\nAt minimum, a requirements.txt file needs to be present with a reference to Panda3D, such as the following, which tells pip that a release of Panda3D 1.10 of at least 1.10.9 is required:\n\npanda3d~=1.10.9\n\nThis is an example setup.py showing how to package the Asteroids <asteroids> sample program into a self-contained executable:\n\nfrom setuptools import setup\n\nsetup(\n    name='asteroids',\n    options={\n        'build_apps': {\n            # Build asteroids.exe as a GUI application\n            'gui_apps': {\n                'asteroids': 'main.py',\n            },",
