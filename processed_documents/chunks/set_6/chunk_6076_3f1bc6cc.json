During the culling stage any portal visible to the camera will be enabled, and render the objects that can be seen through the portal into its specified \"out\" cell. If another portal is visible through the previous one, the process continues. If multiple cameras are used, for example to do split screen play, hide the cells using the same mask set on the camera using camera.setCameraMask(mask).",
