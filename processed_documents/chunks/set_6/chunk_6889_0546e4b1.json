Here's an example of using a Linear Segment:\n\nForce\n\nYou can add different forces to your particle effects here. For example you can use the Noise Force to add some randomness to the movement of particles such as for falling particles used in a snow effect.\n\nNote: There isn't an option in the Particle Panel to set what the individual particles should be relative to. If you want to set that explicitly, use the renderParent argument in the start() call in your code. You will find this useful for particle effects on moving objects, or for example rain and snow.\n\nNote: resizing the particle Panel GUI window might crash the program.",
