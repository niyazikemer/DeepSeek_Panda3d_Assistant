  "content": "Texture pathnames in a bam file may be stored relative to the bam file itself, relative to a directory on the model-path, or with a full pathname to the file, depending on the parameters given to the egg2bam program.\n\nThe program egg2bam is used to convert egg files to bam files. Egg2bam will complain if the textures aren't present. You must install the textures (into your model path) before you convert the bam file. You can run the egg2bam program as follows:\n\negg2bam -ps rel -o bamFileName.bam eggFileName.egg",
