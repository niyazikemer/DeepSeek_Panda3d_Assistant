  "content": "The Copy of Python that comes with Panda\n\nOn Windows, it is not necessary to install Python, because the Windows installer for Panda3D includes a copy. This is a completely normal copy of Python, identical to what you would have if you installed Python using the standard Python installer. Panda's built-in copy of Python is automatically added to the PATH environment variable. This enables you to type \"python\" at the command prompt, and it will run the Python that comes with Panda.\n\nOn macOS, Python 2.7 already comes pre-installed on your system, which will work with Panda3D. However, it is recommended to install a newer version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ .\n\nWhat if I already have a copy of Python?",
