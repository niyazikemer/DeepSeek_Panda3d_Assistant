  "content": "Although a Geom can have any number of GeomPrimitives associated with it, all of the GeomPrimitives must be of the same fundamental primitive type: triangles, lines, or points. A particular Geom might have GeomTriangles, GeomTristrips, and GeomTrifans; or it might have GeomLines and GeomLinestrips; or it might have GeomPoints. But no one Geom can have primitives from two different fundamental types. You can call geom.get_primitive_type() <.Geom.get_primitive_type> to determine the fundamental primitive type stored within a particular Geom.",
