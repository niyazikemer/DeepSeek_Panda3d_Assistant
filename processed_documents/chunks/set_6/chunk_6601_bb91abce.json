  "content": "With either GeomVertexReader or GeomVertexWriter, you can set the current read or write row at any time with the call setRow(). This sets the current read row (GeomVertexReader) or current write row (GeomVertexWriter) to the indicated value; the next call to getData or setData/addData will then operate on the specified row, and increment from there.\n\nGeomVertexRewriter\n\nThe GeomVertexRewriter class exists as a convenience for code that needs to alternately read and write the data on a column. GeomVertexRewriter multiply inherits from GeomVertexReader and GeomVertexWriter, so it supports the getData family of functions, as well as the setData and addData family of functions. It also has both a current read row and a current write row, which might be different.",
