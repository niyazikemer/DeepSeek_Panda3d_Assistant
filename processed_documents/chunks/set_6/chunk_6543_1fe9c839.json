  "content": "Play rate\n\nThe animation play rate may be set to any floating point value, which can be used to speed up or slow down the animation. This is a scale factor on the base animation rate; 1.0 means to play the animation at its normal speed, while 2.0 plays it twice as fast, and 0.5 plays it at half speed. It is also possible to play an animation backwards by specifying a negative play rate, for instance -1.0.\n\npython\n\nactor.setPlayRate(newPlayRate, 'Animation Name')\n\nBlending\n\nMultiple different animations for an actor may be played at the same time, and the animations blended together at runtime. The net result is that, each frame, the actor ends up somewhere between the different poses it would be in for each contributing animation, if each animation were playing independently.",
