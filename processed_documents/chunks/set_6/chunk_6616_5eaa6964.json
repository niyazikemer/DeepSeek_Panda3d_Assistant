So this means that OpenGL callbacks and the like have to be sensitive to the threaded nature of the graphics pipeline. (This is why Panda's interface to the graphics window requires an indirect call: base.win.requestProperties(), rather than base.win.setProperties(). It's necessary because the property-change request must be handled by the draw thread.)\n\nEnabling the Multithreaded Render Pipeline\n\nTo enable this feature, simply set the following variable in your Config.prc file:\n\nthreading-model Cull/Draw",
