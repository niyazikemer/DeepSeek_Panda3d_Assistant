  "content": "ParticleSystem\n\nThis class is the controller of the particle system. The main parameters are:\n\nPool Size: the maximum number of particles the factory can generate Birth Rate: number of seconds between particle births, also it is the time after which the first birth occurs. So if the value is 6 the first litter will be born after 6 seconds.\n\nLitter Size: number of particles created at each birth. If you want all the particles to be born at the same time, set this value to the value of (Pool Size) Litter Spread: this adds a random value in the range [-spread, +spread] to the value of Litter Size.\n\nLifespan: umber of seconds the system will live.\n\nSystem Grows Older: this flag must be set for the Lifespan value to be used. It's very important to remember that particle systems which reach the end of their lifespan are automatically removed from the ParticleSystemManager and if you want to reuse them, they should be added to the ParticleSystemManager again.",
