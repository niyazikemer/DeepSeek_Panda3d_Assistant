  "content": "Notes and caveats\n\nHere are some caveats, quirks, and behaviors to be aware of when working with the physics engine:\n\nYou can add the same force to an object multiple times with repeated calls to ~panda3d.physics.Physical.add_linear_force or ~panda3d.physics.Physical.add_angular_force. The result will be that the total effect will be the effect of the force applied once times the number of times it is applied. Note, however, that to remove the force's effect on the object, you must call the \"remove\" method the same number of times the \"add\" method was called; each call to remove only removes one instance of the force. Of course, it is more efficient to use a single force with magnitude (n x # of copies) than to use the same force multiple times.",
