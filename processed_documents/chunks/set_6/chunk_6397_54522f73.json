  "content": "Thick lines are not supported by the DirectX renderer; in DirectX, the thickness parameter is ignored.\n\nGeomLinestrips\n\nThis is the analogue of a GeomTristrips object: the GeomLinestrips object can store any number of line strips, each of which can have any number of vertices, at least two. Within a particular line strip, the first two vertices define a line segment; and thereafter, each new vertex defines an additional line segment, connected end-to-end with the previous line segment. This primitive type can be used to draw a curve approximation with many bends fairly easily.\n\nGeomPoints\n\nThis is the simplest kind of GeomPrimitive; it stores a number of individual points. Each point has exactly one vertex.",
