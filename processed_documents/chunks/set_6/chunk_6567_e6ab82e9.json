  "content": "DirectScrollBar\n\npython\n\nA DirectScrollBar is similar to the \"scroll bar\" widget commonly used by the user to page through a large document. It consists of a long trough, a thumb that slides along the trough, and a pair of buttons on either side of the trough to scroll one line at a time. A DirectScrollBar can be oriented either vertically or horizontally.\n\nThe DirectScrollBar is similar in function to directslider, but it is specifically designed for scrolling through a large window. In fact, a pair of DirectScrollBars is used to implement the directscrolledframe, which manages this scrolling functionality automatically. (Because DirectScrolledFrame exists, you will probably not need to create a DirectScrollBar directly, unless you have some custom purpose that requires a scroll bar.)",
