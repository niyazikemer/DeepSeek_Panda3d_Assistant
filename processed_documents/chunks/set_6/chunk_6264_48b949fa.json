  "content": "Finally, regardless of the rendering optimizations described above, a particular sorting order is required to render transparency properly (in the absence of the specialized transparency support that only a few graphics cards provide). Transparent and semitransparent objects are normally rendered by blending their semitransparent parts with what has already been drawn to the framebuffer, which means that it is important that everything that will appear behind a semitransparent object must have already been drawn before the semitransparent parts of the occluding object is drawn. This implies that all semitransparent objects must be drawn in order from farthest away to nearest, or in \"back-to-front\" ordering, and furthermore that the opaque objects should all be drawn before any of the semitransparent objects.\n\nPanda achieves these sometimes conflicting sorting requirements through the use of bins.\n\nCull Bins",
