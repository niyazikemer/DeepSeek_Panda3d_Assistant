Particle effects are systems simulated by the movement of many small objects, or particles. They are commonly used to simulate phenomenon like explosions, sparks, fire, smoke, and steam to name a few. Particle effect systems are very complicated. It's not likely that you would be able to create any good systems just by reading a list of available parameters. You need to be able to see and manipulate the systems to really get results. Fortunately, there is a tool built into Panda for visualizing particle effects. particlePanelLoader.py contains the code needed to run the Particle Panel. Run it, and you should see a black screen with a default particle effect, and a second window listing the parameters for that effect.\n\nThere are too many parameters in the Particle Panel to go over them all, however, the main sections are:",
