  "content": "If your fragment shader is self-made, then try to offload some work to your vertex shader.\n\nThere is a simple method to test your scene. Replace your whole fragment shader with the following snippet (if using GLSL):\n\ngl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);\n\nOr the following (if using Cg):\n\no_color = float4(1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);\n\nIf the frame rate doesn't change, then it is the depth complexity. It if changes, it may be the depth complexity or the shader.",
