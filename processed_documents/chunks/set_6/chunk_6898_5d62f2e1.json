  "content": "There is a second level of caching. If the system generates a shader, it will then compare that shader to the other shaders it has generated previously. If it matches a previously-generated shader, it will not need to compile the shader again.\n\nSo, to save the full cost, use the same RenderState. To save most of the cost, use two RenderStates that are similar. By \"similar,\" I mean having the same general structure: ie, two models that both have a texture and a normal map, and both have no vertex colors and neither has a material applied.\n\nCombining Automatic Shaders with Manual Shaders",
