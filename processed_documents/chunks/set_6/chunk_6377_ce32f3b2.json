  "content": "If base.mouseWatcherNode is restricted to the 3D view display region, the mouse won't interact with the menu buttons.\n\nOne way to get around this problem is to create a new MouseWatcher to handle the 3D view display region. By doing so, the mouse can interact with other display regions, such as the one containing the menu, and the program can still get accurate mouse coordinates for the 3D view display region for things like clicking-on-3d-objects which is discussed later in the manual.\n\nCreating a new MouseWatcher and tying it to a display region is a three step process. First, the new MouseWatcher has to be created.\n\nmyMouseWatcher = MouseWatcher()\n# Creates a new mouse watcher",
