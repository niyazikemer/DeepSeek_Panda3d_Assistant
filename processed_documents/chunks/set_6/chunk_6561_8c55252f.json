  "content": "Pathfinding\n\nPathfinding\n\nThis deals with the NPC\u2019s ability to calculate the best route between two traversable points in your Panda3D environment. It requires the creation of a navigation mesh (see \u201cNavigation Mesh\u201d under \"Mesh Generator\" page), which is placed on the surface over which your NPC will be moving. The navigation mesh allows the system to recognize \u201ctraversable nodes\u201d around the mesh, as well as areas which cannot be traversed (areas occupied by an impediment or obstacle for instance).\n\nUsing the PandAI pathfinding system:\n\naiBehaviors.initPathFind(string filename)\n\nThis function activates the path finding with A* for the AI Character. Filename is the name of the file that is generated by the Mesh Generator (Covered in the next section of the manual).\n\n(Note: The file is in .csv format)\n\naiBehaviors.pathFindTo(NodePath np, string type)\n\naiBehaviors.pathFindTo(Vec3 pos, string type)",
