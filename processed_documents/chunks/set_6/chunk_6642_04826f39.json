  "content": "Note that this BoundingVolume is not the smallest possible. For instance, a sphere of radius 1 has a .BoundingSphere with radius 1.73205. Panda doesn't bother going through all the trouble it would take to compute a tight spherical bounds, because the loose bounds that it computes is good enough for Panda's needs. The extra performance gain you'd get for having a tighter culling bounds isn't worth the effort it would take to compute it.\n\nAlthough it doesn't use it, Panda can create a tighter bounding box. This \"tight\" bounding box is the smallest axis-aligned box that is no smaller than its enclosed geometry. Thus, it satisfies its definition as a \"tight\" bounds, because you will not find a tighter bounding volume that is also a box. You can retrieve the bounding box using the ~.NodePath.get_tight_bounds() method. This box can be shown with ~.NodePath.show_tight_bounds().\n\nFurther tweaking of the bounding volume used must be done manually",
