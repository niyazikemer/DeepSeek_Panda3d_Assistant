  "content": "Multitexture Introduction\n\nPanda3D provides the ability to apply more than one texture image at a time to the polygons of a model. The textures are applied on top of each other, like coats of paint; very much like the \"layers\" in a popular photo-paint program.\n\nTo layer a second texture on a model, you will have to understand Panda's concept of a .TextureStage. Think of a TextureStage as a slot to hold a single texture image. You can have as many different TextureStages as you want in your scene, and each TextureStage might be used on one, several, or all models.\n\nWhen you apply a texture to a model, for instance with the ~.NodePath.set_texture() call, you are actually binding the texture to a particular TextureStage. If you do not specify a TextureStage to use, Panda assumes you mean the \"default\" TextureStage object, which is a global pointer which you can access as .TextureStage.get_default().",
