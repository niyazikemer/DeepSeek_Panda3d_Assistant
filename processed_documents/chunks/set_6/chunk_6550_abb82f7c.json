  "content": "The Task Manager\n\nOn a more complex program, you may find that animations can not be loaded from any point in your program. In any application there needs to be exactly one call to base.run() <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.run>, and it should be the last thing you do after starting up. This starts the task manager. Think of this as the main loop of the application: your startup procedure is to set up your loading screen, start any initial tasks or intervals, hang any initial messenger hooks, and then go get lost in base.run() <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.run>. Thereafter everything must run in a task <tasks-and-event-handling>, in an interval, or is a response to a message. This is true for both animations and sound <loading-and-playing-sounds-and-music>.",
