  "content": "Cg Shader Tutorial\n\nCaution\n\nSupport for Cg shaders will be deprecated in an upcoming version of Panda3D.\n\nCg Shader Tutorials\n\nPanda has the ability to process shaders written in the Cg shader language. In this tutorial series, you will learn how to write shaders for Panda3D in Cg. While there are panda specific things in this tutorial you should be able to learn how to write Cg shaders that can be used in other engines.\n\nPre-requisites\n\nYou should be able to write a simple math program in C. Do not underestimate this. If you start writing your own shaders without any prior knowledge about a C-like language it is as hard as starting to write a Panda3D application without knowing anything about Python.
