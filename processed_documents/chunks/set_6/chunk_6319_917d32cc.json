  "content": "Caution\n\nInexperienced 3D modelers sometimes create models with the polygons facing inward: ie, the visible side of the polygon is on the inside of the 3D model, and the see-through side is on the outside. As a result, the 3D model can look very weird - it can have holes, or it can look inside-out. Turning off backface culling can sort of \"fix\" these models, at a heavy cost: first, it makes them render half as fast, and second, it causes weird lighting artifacts (because the video card is calculating the lighting for the inside of the model, not the outside). This is not a real solution to bad 3D modeling: the only real fix is to make the 3D models correctly in the first place.\n\nIn other words, don't alter the backface or frontface culling unless you're using an algorithm that requires it, such as stencil shadows.\n\nRendering Double-Sided",
