  "content": "Other Material Methods\n\nBesides the setter methods covered above, you can also get material properties using their get methods, such as ~.Material.get_shininess(), ~.Material.get_diffuse(), etc.\n\nProperties can also be reset by using the clear methods: ~.Material.clear_ambient(), ~.Material.clear_specular(), etc. Shininess does not have a clear method.\n\nAdditionally you can check if a material has a property with the has methods: ~.Material.has_ambient(), ~.Material.has_emission(), etc.\n\nMaterials have two other methods that have not been covered yet, set_local(bool) <.Material.set_local> and set_twoside(bool) <.Material.set_twoside>. The former controls whether to use camera-relative specular highlights or orthogonal specular highlights. This should be set to True unless an orthogonal projection camera is in use. The latter controls if lighting should appear on both sides of a polygon. Both these methods have equivalent get methods.\n\nInspecting and Replacing Materials",
