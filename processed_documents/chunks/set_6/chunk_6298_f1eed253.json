  "content": "If you want to export a scene with joints and skinning data so that it can later accept any exported animation select \u201cmodel \u201c from Animation box. This term can be slightly confusing initially, but once you realize we\u2019re talking about what type of animation (if any) to export the distinction between \u201cnone\u201d and \u201cmodel\u201d is slightly more clear. Remember, model doesn\u2019t just mean polygon geometry, it implies that the model has joints and possibly a skin cluster in the scene file. It is meant to accept animation data from a separate file or to be animated by the programmer through code.\n\nIf you only want to export the animation data from a scene select \u201cchan\u201d. This will simply write out the key frames of your scene and what joints those key frames apply to into the egg file. This file is almost always used with a separate egg file that was egged out with the \u201cmodel\u201d option.",
