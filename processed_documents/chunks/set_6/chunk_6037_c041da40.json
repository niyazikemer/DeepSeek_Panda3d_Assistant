  "content": "Vertex Pool\n\nA vertex pool is a set of vertices. All geometry is created by referring to vertices by number in a particular vertex pool. There may be one or several vertex pools in an egg file, but all vertices that make up a single polygon must come from the same vertex pool. The body of a <VertexPool> entry is simply a list of one or more <Vertex> entries, as follows:\n\n<VertexPool> name {\n  <Vertex> number1 {\n  }\n  <Vertex> numer2 {\n  }\n  ...\n}\n\nVertices\n\nA <Vertex> entry is only valid within a vertex pool definition. The number is the index by which this vertex will be referenced. It is optional; if it is omitted, the vertices are implicitly numbered consecutively beginning at one. If the number is supplied, the vertices need not be consecutive.",
