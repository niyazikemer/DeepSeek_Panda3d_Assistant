  "content": "BoundingVolume\n\nA ~.BoundingVolume is a solid enclosing all the geometry of a node and its children that is used for culling and collision detection. (If the BoundingVolume for a node is not visible, there is no need to render that node.) Panda will generate \"bounds\" for each node automatically by creating bounding volumes.\n\nPanda defines the \"bounds\" of a node to be a geometric bounding volume, of an arbitrary shape (but usually a sphere) that is no smaller than its enclosed geometry. The ~.PandaNode.get_bounds() method returns an acceptable bounding volume. It is indeed no smaller than the enclosed geometry. This makes it suitable for use in culling operations and so on. To check the size of the bounding volume, use ~.NodePath.show_bounds().",
