This can automatically ensure that your\nlighting normals are unit-length, which may be particularly necessary in\nthe presence of scales in the scene graph. Turning it off ('none') may\nproduce a small performance benefit. respect-effective-normal bool 1 This should be true to support the effective_normal interface of\npolygons. Set it false to disable this feature, so that all collision\nsolids (including polygons and planes) use their actual normal for\nintersection and physics tests. respect-prev-transform bool 0 Set this true to have all CollisionTraversers in the world respect",
