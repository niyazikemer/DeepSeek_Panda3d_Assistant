  "content": "Now, lets look at the shader that we have in this tutorial. As previously mentioned, the vshader function handles vertices. The only thing a vertex shader can do is calculate properties for vertices. One such property is the position. A vertex shader can move vertices around. In this tutorial we only move around the vertices but in the next tutorial we will calculate more properties for the vertex. A vertex shader cannot create new vertices nor can it delete vertices. This is a limitation that geometry shaders try to solve.",
