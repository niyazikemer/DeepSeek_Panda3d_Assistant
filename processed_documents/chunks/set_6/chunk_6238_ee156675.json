  "content": "The Low-Level API and the High-Level Utilities\n\nPanda3D contains a very low-level API for creating offscreen buffers, creating render-target textures, and the like. This low-level API is extremely flexible: it gives you a great deal of control over what kinds of buffers you create, over what gets rendered into them, over how the data gets transferred to a texture, and so forth. The advantage of using the low-level API is that you can control everything. The disadvantage is that you have to control everything, and there's a lot of stuff to control.",
