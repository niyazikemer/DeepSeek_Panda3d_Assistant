  "content": "The above string defines a different thread for each of App, Cull, and Draw. You can also assign these three phases to threads in different ways:\n\nthreading-model /Draw\n\nCreates a two-thread model: assigns App and Cull together on the main thread, and puts Draw on its own thread. This is most appropriate when the total amount of time for App + Cull in your application is similar to the total amount of time for Draw.\n\nthreading-model Cull/Cull\nthreading-model Cull\n\nThese two are equivalent and create a different two-thread model: App is on its own thread, and Cull and Draw are together on a separate thread. This is most appropriate when the total amount of time for App in your application is similar to the total amount of time for Cull + Draw.",
