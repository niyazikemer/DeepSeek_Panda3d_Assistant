  "content": "Dynamic Cube Maps\n\npython\n\nSince the six faces of a cube map are really just six different views of a scene from the same point, it's possible to generate a cube map automatically by rendering these six different views at runtime.\n\nThis is really just a form of offscreen rendering to a texture. Instead of rendering just one 2-D texture image, though, rendering a dynamic cube map means rendering six different 2-D images, one for each face of a cube map texture.\n\nPanda3D makes this easy for you. To start rendering a dynamic cube map, simply call:\n\nrig = NodePath('rig')\nbuffer = base.win.makeCubeMap(name, size, rig)\n\nThis will return an offscreen GraphicsBuffer that will be used to render the cube map. The three required parameters to makeCubeMap() are:\n\nThere are also additional, optional parameters to makeCubeMap():",
