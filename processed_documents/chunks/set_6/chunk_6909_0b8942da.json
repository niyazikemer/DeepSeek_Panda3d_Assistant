  "content": "There are too many parameters in the Particle Panel to go over them all, however, the main sections are:\n\nSystem: Details on how many particles are allowed and how often they are created.\n\nFactory: Sets the properties of particles when they are created.\n\nEmitter: Sets an area that particles can be created in and their initial velocities.\n\nRenderer: How the particles will be drawn on screen (Hint: Most good particle effects are sprites with a small texture at very low alpha (around .1) heavily blending between each other.).\n\nForces: Sets forces that can be used to move existing particles.",
