  "content": "Datagram Protocol\n\nUnderpinning Panda's networking capabilities are the classes that compose the datagram protocol. These classes allow for developer-defined packets to be transmitted using either the UDP or TCP protocols. Panda's datagram layer can serve as a solid foundation for developing higher-level networking abstractions.\n\nThis section describes the classes used to establish a connection (.QueuedConnectionManager, .QueuedConnectionListener, .QueuedConnectionReader, and .ConnectionWriter), as well as the classes that transmit information (.NetDatagram, .PyDatagram, and .PyDatagramIterator).\n\nclient-server-connection transmitting-data",
