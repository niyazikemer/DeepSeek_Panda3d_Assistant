By default, the function receives one parameter, which is the task object; the task object carries information about the task itself, such as the amount of time that the task has been running.\n\nYour task function should return when it has finished processing for the frame. Because all tasks are run in the same thread, you must not spend too much time processing any one task function; the entire application will be locked up until the function returns.\n\npython",
