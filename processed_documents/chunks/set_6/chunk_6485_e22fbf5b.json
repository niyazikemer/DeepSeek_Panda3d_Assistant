  "content": "The Python Debugger\n\nPython is a very powerful interactive and interpreted language. Python's development cycle is very fast. Often the most effective way to to debug is to output relevant information. Having said that, there are many ways to enhance productivity with knowledge of good debugging techniques.\n\nUsing python -i mode\n\nPython programs may be developed and tested with the help of the interactive mode of the Python interpreter, which, allows program components to be debugged, traced, profiled, and tested interactively. When invoking python with -i, this ensures that an interactive session of python is invoked. With regards to Panda3D this requires a little explanation. Panda3D programs typically have a command called base.run() to start rendering, so here's one way to start an interactive session. On the command prompt type:\n\npython -i myPandaFile.py\n\nAfter Panda3D has loaded, make sure the command window has focus and type Ctrl-C. This will show a python prompt like so:\n\n>>>",
