  "content": "Loading and Playing Sounds and Music\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe implementation of the sound system in Panda3D allows for a division of audio into two categories - Sound Effects and Music. This division is only a convenience for programmers as Panda3D allows these two audio groups to be treated individually. These differences are explained on the next page.\n\nBasics\n\nLoading a Sound\n\npython\n\nLoading sound is done through the ~direct.showbase.Loader class by supplying the path to the sound file as a parameter for ~direct.showbase.Loader.Loader.loadSfx(). Here's an example:\n\nbase = ShowBase()\nmySound = base.loader.loadSfx(\"path/to/sound_file.ogg\")\n\ncpp\n\nLoading sound is done through the AudioManager class by supplying the path to the sound file as a parameter for ~AudioManager.get_sound(). Here's an example:\n\nPT(AudioManager) AM = AudioManager::create_AudioManager();\nPT(AudioSound) mySound = AM->get_sound(\"path/to/sound_file.ogg\") ;",
