To implement this in Panda3D, you might do this:\n\nfor i in range(50):\n    dancer = Actor.Actor(\"chorus-line-dancer.egg\", {\"kick\":\"kick.egg\"})\n    dancer.loop(\"kick\")\n    dancer.setPos(i*5,0,0)\n    dancer.reparentTo(render)\n\nHere is the scene graph that we just created:\n\nThis works fine, but it is a little expensive. Animating a model involves a lot of per-vertex matrix calculations. In this case, we're animating 50 copies of the exact same model using 50 copies of the exact same animation. That's a lot of redundant calculations. It would seem that there must be some way to avoid calculating the exact same values 50 times. There is: the technique is called instancing.",
