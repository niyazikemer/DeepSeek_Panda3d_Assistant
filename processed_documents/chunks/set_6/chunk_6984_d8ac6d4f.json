However, since most of the documentation uses Python, it may be better to learn Panda3D using Python first, and then switch to C++ later. If you do switch, the function calls are very similar.\n\nC++ is an object-oriented high-level multi-purpose language. It is actually a copy of the C programming language, but object-oriented, with more functions. Here are a few links to C++ tutorials that might be useful for you:\n\nhttp://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/\n\nwww.learncpp.com",
