  "content": "The problem is when you have a single really long frame. In this case, anything you do at the end of this long frame is considered to have actually happened at the beginning of the frame, and when the next frame rolls around (after some considerable time has elapsed from the previous frame), Panda has to skip over all of the intervening time to catch up, and you miss seeing some part or all of your interval or animation.\n\nThere are several easy solutions. One is to munge the clock while you're computing your slow frame so that it doesn't actually allow time to advance during this period, by putting this line after your loop, etc.\n\nglobalClock.setFrameTime(globalClock.getRealTime())\n\nThis simply resets the \"frame time\" to whatever the current real time is towards the end of your long frame. This will break the atomic-frame rule for (only) that one frame, but in this case that's what you want to happen.",
