  "content": "Basic animation playing\n\nAnimations may either be played or looped. When an animation is played, the actor goes through the animation once. When an animation is looped, the animation will play continuously. There is no tweening done between the last and the first frame, so if an animation is going to be looped, it needs to be constructed with that thought in mind. Finally, animations may be stopped at any point. When an animation is stopped, the actor will stay in the position it stopped on.\n\npython\n\nactor.play('Animation Name')\nactor.loop('Animation Name')\nactor.stop()\n\nYou may use the ~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.pose() method to tell an actor to hold a particular frame of the animation. Frames are numbered beginning at 0.\n\npython\n\nactor.pose('Animation Name', FrameNumber)",
