  "content": "To start an Interval playing, use one of the following:\n\ninterval.start()\ninterval.start(startT, endT, playRate)\ninterval.loop()\ninterval.loop(startT, endT, playRate)\n\nThe three parameters are optional. The startTime and endTime parameters define the subset of the interval to play; these should be given as times in seconds, measured from the start of the interval. The playRate, if specified, allows you play the interval slower or faster than real time; the default is 1.0, to play at real time.\n\nNormally, an Interval will play to the end and stop by itself, but you can stop a playing Interval prematurely:\n\ninterval.finish()\n\nThis will stop the interval and move its state to its final state, as if it had played to the end. This is a very important point, and it allows you to define critical cleanup actions within the interval itself, which are guaranteed to have been performed by the time the interval is finished.\n\nYou can also temporarily pause and resume an interval:",
