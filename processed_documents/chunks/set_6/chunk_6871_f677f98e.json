The number should be in the range 1 to 9, where larger values are\nslower but give better compression. vertex-data-page-size int 262144 The number of bytes to allocate at a time for vertex data. This also\ncontrols the page size that is compressed or written to disk when vertex\ndata pages are evicted from memory. vertex-data-page-threads int 1 When this is nonzero (and Panda has been compiled with thread\nsupport) then this number of sub-threads will be spawned to evict vertex",
