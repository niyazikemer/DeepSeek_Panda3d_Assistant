  "content": "Deferred Shader Compilation\n\nWhen you create a Cg shader object, it compiles the shader, checking for syntax errors. But it does not check whether or not your video card is powerful enough to handle the shader. This only happens later on, when you try to render something with the shader. In the case of GLSL shaders, all of this will only happen when the shader is first used to render something.\n\nIn the unusual event that your computer contains multiple video cards, the shader may be compiled more than once. It is possible that the compilation could succeed for one video card, and fail for the other.",
