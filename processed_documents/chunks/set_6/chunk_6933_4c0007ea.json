  "content": "The \"POSITION\" keyword is a hint for the GPU. The GPU then knows that is should assign l_position to an internal POSITION register (register is a simplification, this term might not be precise). This tells the GPU that it will later have to draw the output of POSITION on the screen. Currently the GPU does not know what color the pixels will have but it can calculate a position on the screen for every given POSITION. The GPU itself is not as smart as one might think, we need to do some not so simple math first to help the GPU calculate the correct position on the screen.\n\nMore or less everything that was said about the vertex shader is true for the fragment shader. The minimum requirement is that a fragment shader has to create a color, to do this we have to assign a float4 to o_color. Again, you can name this anything you like, but this time it needs to be prefixed with o_ and have the \"COLOR\" keyword attached.",
