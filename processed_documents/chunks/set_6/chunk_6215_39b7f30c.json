  "content": "Automatic Texture Coordinates\n\nIn addition to using texture coordinates that are built into the model, it is also possible to generate texture coordinates at runtime. Usually you would use this technique to achieve some particular effect, such as projective texturing or environment mapping, but sometimes you may simply want to apply a texture to a model that does not already have texture coordinates, and this is the only way to do that.\n\nThe texture coordinates generated by this technique are generated on-the-fly, and are not stored within the model. When you turn off the generation mode, the texture coordinates cease to exist.\n\nUse the .NodePath.set_tex_gen() method to enable automatic generation of texture coordinates:\n\npython\n\nnodePath.setTexGen(textureStage, texGenMode)\n\ncpp\n\nnodePath.set_tex_gen(textureStage, texGenMode);",
