  "content": "In this diagram the original camera frustum is seen in blue, this is used to cull the current cell. The shaded areas represent areas visible after culling. The camera is looking through a portal into the next cell, and so the frustum is reduced (seen in cyan) so as to render only that which is visible through the portal. This reduced frustum is then used to check visibility of additional portals in other cells, and it will be reduced again as it passed through more portals (seen in red and green). Note that even though more cells are visible to the original camera frustum, there is no direct line of visibility and so they are not even considered.\n\nHow are Cells and Portals handled in Panda3D?",
