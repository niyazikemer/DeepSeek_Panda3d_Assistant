  "content": "The contents of the glow buffer are then rendered into another offscreen buffer, the \"blur x\" buffer, using a shader that does a one-dimensional horizontal blur. The contents of the \"blur x\" buffer are then rendered into a third offscreen buffer, the \"blur y\" buffer, using a shader that does a one-dimensional vertical blur. Taken together, the two one-dimensional blurs add up to a two-dimensional blur. The result is that the glowing lines that were rendered into the glow buffer are smeared outward, forming little halos.\n\nIn a final step, the blurred texture is applied to the main window using additive blending - ie, the halos are added to the scene.\n\nBack to the List of Sample Programs:\n\nsamples",
