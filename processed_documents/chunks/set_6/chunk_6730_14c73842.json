  "content": "matrix. compress-chan-quality int 95 The quality level is an integer number that generally ranges between\n0 and 100, where smaller numbers indicate greater compression at the\ncost of quality, and larger numbers indicate higher quality but less\ncompression. Generally, 95 is the highest useful value; values between\n95 and 100 produce substantially larger, but not substantially better,\noutput files. This is akin to the JPEG compression level. compress-channels bool 0 Set this true to enable lossy compression of animation channels when\nwriting to the bam file. This serves to reduce the size of the bam file\nonly; it does not reduce the memory footprint of the channels when the\nbam file is loaded. compressed-textures bool 0 Set this to true to compress textures as they are loaded into\ntexture memory, if the driver supports this. Specifically, this changes\nthe meaning of set_compression(Texture::CM_default) to",
