  "content": "Automatic use of Shaders\n\nPanda3D supports several advanced rendering techniques such as per-pixel lighting, normal mapping, gloss mapping, glow mapping, HDR, bloom, and cartoon inking out of the box. In order to make these work, Panda is quietly uploading shaders to your video card. You don't need to write shaders to use these features, or even know much about shaders. You just turn these features on. To learn how to turn these features on, read about these features in their own sections of the manual.\n\nWriting your own Shaders\n\nIf what you want to do is one of the things that Panda already supports automatically, such as per-pixel lighting, normal mapping, gloss mapping, glow mapping, HDR, bloom, or cartoon inking, you don't need to write any shaders. Just let Panda handle it.",
