  "content": "And there is also one generic form:\n\nnodePath.setTexTransform(TextureStage, transform);\n\nThis last method sets a generic TransformState object. This is the same kind of 4x4 transform matrix object that you can get from a NodePath via e.g., .NodePath.get_transform(). You can also construct a new TransformState via a number of methods like TransformState::make_pos(VBase3(0, 1, 0)) <.TransformState.make_pos>. If you intend to apply a 2-d transform only, you should restrict yourself to methods like TransformState::make_pos2d(VBase2(0, 1)) <.TransformState.make_pos2d>; using only 2-d operations may allow the graphics backend to use a slightly simpler calculation.",
