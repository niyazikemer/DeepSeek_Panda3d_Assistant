  "content": "There are of course cases where you don't know the density (although it is easy to calculate), or when the object is not easy to fit in a box shape. OdeMass provides the following methods:\n\npanda3d.core\n\nMore methods are listed on the ~panda3d.ode.OdeMass page in the API Reference.\n\nFor more complex shapes, you might want to decompose the object into several simple ones, and use the add(other) method to add the masses together. If that still isn't enough, you might want to set the individual parameters of the mass using setParameters, which is not explained here because it that goes beyond the scope of this manual page. Note that the shape you set is not actually used for collisions: it's just used to roughly determine how the mass is divided in the object.",
