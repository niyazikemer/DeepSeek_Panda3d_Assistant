  "content": "If we take a closer look at the vertex shader, we can see a new line with the keyword \"uniform\" and a line with the \"in\" keyword. The \"in\" keyword means that there is some input from somewhere, in this case the input is named vtx_position. Referencing the List of Possible Shader Inputs <list-of-possible-cg-shader-inputs>, you can see that vtx_position is a reserved name. The input vtx_position gives us is the vertex coordinates for the vertex as it appears in the egg file.",
