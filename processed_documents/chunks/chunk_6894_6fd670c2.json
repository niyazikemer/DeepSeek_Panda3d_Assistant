There is furthermore a limit of 120 joints that may be active at any given time. This limit may be raised in the future.\n\nKnown Limitations\n\nThe shader generator replaces the fixed-function pipeline with a shader. To make this work, we have to duplicate the functionality of the entire fixed function pipeline. That's a lot of stuff. We haven't implemented all of it yet. Here's what's supported:\n\nflat colors, vertex colors and color scales\n\nlighting\n\nnormal maps\n\ngloss maps\n\nglow maps\n\nmaterials\n\n1D, 2D, 3D, cube textures\n\nmost texture stage and combine modes\n\nlight ramps (for cartoon shading)\n\nmost texgen modes (sphere / cube map modes require Panda3D 1.10.14)\n\ntexmatrix\n\nfog",
