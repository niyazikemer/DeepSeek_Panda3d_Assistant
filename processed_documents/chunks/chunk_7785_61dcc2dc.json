  "content": "When a model is loaded from an egg file, normally all the state definitions required to render the geometry will be stored on these per-Geom state definitions, rather than at the GeomNode level. These per-Geom states will override any state that is inherited from the scene graph, unless that scene graph state has a priority higher than the default priority of zero. (This is why it is necessary to specify a second parameter of 1 to the nodePath.setTexture() <.NodePath.setTexture> call, if you want to replace a texture that was applied to a model in the egg file.)",
