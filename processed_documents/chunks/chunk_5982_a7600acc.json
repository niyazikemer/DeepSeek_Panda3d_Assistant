  "content": "Pipeline Tips\n\nThis section isn't totally related to Panda3D. However, these are a few good pointers on how to keep the 'art to programmer' pipeline running smoothly.\n\nHow artists can help programmers with the pipeline\n\n\"Keep renaming to a minimum, preferably with good names to start with, and especially for parts or joints that the programmer will have to manipulate.\"\n\nProgrammers generally deal with objects by their names, not with a graphical tool like artists. Every time a name changes, a programmer has to make the change in his or her code, and often has to hunt through the egg to try and figure out what the name has changed to. In a large model, this can be very time-consuming. If you do have to change a name, make sure to let the programmer know when you give him or her the new model.\n\n\"Check your model in pview before handing it off.\"",
