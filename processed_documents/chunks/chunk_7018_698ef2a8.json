  "content": "Note that the computation required to perform ~.NodePath.wrt_reparent_to() is a floating-point matrix computation and is therefore inherently imprecise. This means that if you use ~.NodePath.wrt_reparent_to() repeatedly, thousands of times on the same node, it may eventually accumulate enough numerical inaccuracies to introduce a slight scale on the object (for instance, a scale of 1, 1, 0.99999); if left unchecked, this scale could eventually become noticeable.\n\nBeginners tend to overuse this method; you should not use ~.NodePath.wrt_reparent_to() unless there is a real reason to use it.\n\nChanging the Color\n\nColor changes are another common alteration. Values for color are floating point numbers from 0 to 1, 0 being black, 1 being white.\n\npython\n\nmyNodePath.setColor(R, G, B, A)\n\ncpp\n\nmyNodePath.set_color(R, G, B, A);",
