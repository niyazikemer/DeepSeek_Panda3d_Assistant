Read the hello world <tutorial> tutorial and understand the \"Solar System\" sample that comes with the Panda3D distribution. You should also have a good understanding of how the scene graph <the-scene-graph> works. If you're interested in writing a shadow mapping shader, it helps to have a solid understanding of how the depth buffer <depth-test-and-depth-write> works.\n\nRead the first chapter from NVIDIA's Cg Tutorial. You do not have to understand it fully, but at least you know who invented Cg and what it is for. The NVIDIA and ATI developer sites also have plenty of useful information about shaders.\n\nYou should also have the List of Possible Shader Inputs <list-of-possible-cg-shader-inputs> page handy.\n\nTutorials\n\nBaseline Panda application <cg-tutorial-part-1>\n\nThe Simplest Possible Shader <cg-tutorial-part-2>. So simple that it's useless.\n\nThe simplest possible useful shader <cg-tutorial-part-3>.",
