Every GeomVertexData has an associated GeomVertexFormat, which describes how the data in that object is stored.\n\nJust as a GeomVertexData object is really a list of one or more GeomVertexArrayData objects, a GeomVertexFormat object is a list of one or more GeomVertexArrayFormat objects, each of which defines the structure of the corresponding array. There will be one GeomVertexArrayFormat object for each array in the format. Each GeomVertexArrayFormat, in turn, consists of a list of GeomVertexColumn objects, one for each column in the array. For instance, the format for a GeomVertexData with six columns, distributed over three different arrays, might look like this:",
