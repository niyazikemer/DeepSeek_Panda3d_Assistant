  "content": "Panda3D can generate sphere maps for you. The above sphere map was generated with the following code:\n\nscene = loader.loadModel('bvw-f2004--streetscene/street-scene.egg')\nscene.reparentTo(render)\nscene.setZ(-2)\nbase.saveSphereMap('streetscene_env.jpg', size = 256)\n\nThe idea is simply to put the camera in the middle of your environment, approximately where your shiny object would be. Then just call base.saveSphereMap() <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.saveSphereMap>, and a suitable sphere map image will be generated and written to disk for you.\n\nNow you can apply the environment map to just about any object you like. For instance, the teapot:\n\ntex = loader.loadTexture('streetscene_env.jpg')\nteapot.setTexGen(TextureStage.getDefault(), TexGenAttrib.MEyeSphereMap)\nteapot.setTexture(tex)",
