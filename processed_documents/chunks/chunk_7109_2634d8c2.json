Usually, you want to define these such that the ready state is the way the button looks most of the time, the press state looks like the button has been depressed, the rollover state is lit up, and the disabled state is grayed out. In fact, the DirectButton interfaces will set these NodePaths up for you, if you use the simple forms of the constructor (for instance, if you specify just a single text string to the text parameter).\n\nSometimes you want to have explicit control over the various states, for instance to display a different text string in each state. To do this, you can pass a 4-tuple to the text parameter (or to many of the other parameters, such as relief or geom), where each element of the tuple is the parameter value for the corresponding state, like this:",
