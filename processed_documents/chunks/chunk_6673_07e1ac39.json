  "content": "There is one more child of render2d to take note of, called pixel2d. This is scaled in such a way that one Panda unit represents one pixel in the window. The origin, (0, 0, 0) is in the upper left corner of the window. The lower right corner has x and z values equal to the width and -height of the window respectively. As Panda3D uses a Z-Up Right coordinate system, the Y coordinate in the window will actually be the inverted Z coordinate in Panda. This node is especially helpful when you want to do pixel-perfect positioning and scaling.\n\nRendering Text\n\nPanda3D includes support for easily rendering dynamic text onscreen or in the 3-d world. It supports full use of the Unicode character set, so it can easily render international languages (including Asian languages, when used with an appropriate font).\n\npython",
