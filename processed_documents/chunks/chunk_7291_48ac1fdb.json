  "content": "motherboard-integrated-video. Motherboard video is very misleading. The chips have names like \"Radeon\" and \"GeForce\" that we have come to associate with speed, but these chips are an order of magnitude slower than real video cards. Programming for these chips requires special consideration.\n\ntoo-many-polygons. This is at the bottom of the likelihood list, but it can still happen. Usually this happens in combination with something else, e.g. if you have a large vertex shader, performance can be drastically reduced for each vertex you add.\n\nmiscellaneous. There are a lot of small things that have a surprisingly large impact on performance. For instance, printing messages on the console can be very slow in Windows. This section lists a number of miscellaneous things that can bog you down.",
