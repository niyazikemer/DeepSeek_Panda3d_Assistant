  "content": "Given a 800x600 screen, the GPU needs to process 480,000 fragment shader calls. As even the highest end GPU right now doesn't have that many processors, each processor will run the fragment shader multiple times. If your fragment or vertex shader is too complex, the GPU would not be able to process it in a timely manner and the FPS would drop. Today shaders can be complex but you should not expect a single shader to be able to do everything. Often you would need to write many specialized shaders which you then carefully apply to your scene. The Auto Shader generator in Panda3D is an example of this. A normal mapped node would have a different shader from a node that has a glow map applied to it but you do not see this as the Auto Shader Generator creates the necessary specialized shader for you.",
