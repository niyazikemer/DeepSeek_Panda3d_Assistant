If so, the main loop must be called, using the function framework.main_loop(). This is equivalent to the base.run() function in Python.\n\nif (window != nullptr) {\n  nout << \"Opened the window successfully!\\n\";\n\n  // Put here your own code, such as the loading of your models\n\n  framework.main_loop();\n} else {\n  nout << \"Could not load the window!\\n\";\n}\n\nAfterwards, we need to close the framework:\n\nframework.close_framework();\nreturn (0);\n\nNow, compile and run <running-your-program> your file and you have your own window opened!\n\nThis is the completed application:\n\n// Include all the stuff\n#include \"pandaFramework.h\"\n#include \"pandaSystem.h\"",
