  "content": "Both functions are optional.  If either function is omitted, the\n    state is still defined, but nothing is done when transitioning\n    into (or out of) the state.\n\n    Additionally, you may define a filterState() function for each\n    state.  The purpose of this function is to decide what state to\n    transition to next, if any, on receipt of a particular input.  The\n    input is always a string and a tuple of optional parameters (which\n    is often empty), and the return value should either be None to do\n    nothing, or the name of the state to transition into.  For\n    example::\n\n        def filterRed(self, request, args):\n            if request in ['Green']:\n                return (request,) + args\n            return None\n\n        def filterYellow(self, request, args):\n            if request in ['Red']:\n                return (request,) + args\n            return None",
