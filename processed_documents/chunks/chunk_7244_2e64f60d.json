This is why it's recommended to always use PointerTo except in very rare, low-level cases.\n\nWarning\n\nThe ~.ReferenceCount.unref() method should not be used if it may cause the reference count to reach zero. This is because a member function cannot destruct the object it is called on, so this will leak memory. Instead, you should use the unref_delete(pt) macro to decrease the reference count unless you are absolutely sure that it will not reach zero.\n\nWeak Pointer",
