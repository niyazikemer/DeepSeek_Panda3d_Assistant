  "content": "A CollisionRay is created by specifing an origin point, and a direction vector. The direction vector need not be normalized.\n\nray = CollisionRay(ox, oy, oz, dx, dy, dz)\n\nCollisionLine\n\nThis is essentially the same as a CollisionRay, except it extends to infinity in both directions. It is constructed with the same parameters, an origin point and a direction vector.\n\nline = CollisionLine(ox, oy, oz, dx, dy, dz)\n\nCollisionSegment\n\nA segment is another variant on the CollisionRay that does not extend to infinity, but only goes to a certain point and stops. It is useful when you want to put a limit on how far the CollisionRay would otherwise reach.\n\nA CollisionSegment is constructed by specifying the two end points.\n\nsegment = CollisionSegment(ax, ay, az, bx, by, bz)\n\nCollisionParabola\n\nA parabola is another variant on the CollisionRay that bends. It is useful when you want to test with arcs, such as a cannonball shot.\n\nCollisionBox",
