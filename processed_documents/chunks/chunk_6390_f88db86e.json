  "content": "GeomPrimitive\n\nIn order to use the vertices in a geomvertexdata to render anything, Panda needs to have a .GeomPrimitive of some kind, which indexes into the vertex table and tells Panda how to tie together the vertices to make lines, triangles, or individual points.\n\nThere are several different kinds of .GeomPrimitive objects, one for each different kind of primitive. Each GeomPrimitive object actually stores several different individual primitives, each of which is represented simply as a list of vertex numbers, indexing into the vertices stored in the associated GeomVertexData. For some GeomPrimitive types, like GeomTriangles, all the primitives must have a fixed number of vertex numbers (3, in the case of GeomTriangles); for others, like GeomTristrips, each primitive can have a different number of vertex numbers.\n\nFor instance, a .GeomTriangles object containing three triangles, and a .GeomTristrips containing two triangle strips, might look like this:",
