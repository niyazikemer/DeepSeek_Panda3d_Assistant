  "content": "You will also need to create a .FrameBufferProperties object. This defines important properties such as the number of bits you wish to allocate for red, green, and blue channels; as well as the number of bits for depth buffer; and whether you require a stencil buffer or special multisampling bits for antialiasing. Your graphics card may be able to switch itself into one of several different configurations, and you can use the FrameBufferProperties to request certain properties that are more important to you. Note, however, that there is no guarantee that the graphics card you are running on will be able to provide everything you ask for (but you can later ask what properties you actually got). You can get a default FrameBufferProperties object using .FrameBufferProperties.get_default(). The default FrameBufferProperties has its settings already filled according to the Config.prc file variables; it is usually a good choice to use.",
