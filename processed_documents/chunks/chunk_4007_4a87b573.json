It is set up to mimic\n          the original display region - it is the same size,\n          uses the same clear colors, and contains a DisplayRegion\n          that uses the original camera.\n\n        * A fullscreen quad and an orthographic camera to render\n          that quad are both created.  The original camera is\n          removed from the original window, and in its place, the\n          orthographic quad-camera is installed.",
