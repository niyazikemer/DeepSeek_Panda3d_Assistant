After dialing in the settings and selecting the file path, click \"Export glTF 2.0\" to produce the glTF file.\n\nOnce you have the .gltf (or .glb) file, follow the instructions on this page <gltf-files> to load the model into Panda3D.\n\nOption 3: Exporting to Egg\n\nThere is a community-provided Blender add-on called YABEE, which adds an option to the Blender GUI for exporting egg-files. This is considered the most mature and stable add-on for Blender, however, it only works with Blender 2.5x, 2.6x and 2.7x. It does not work with newer versions, and as such is no longer recommended.\n\nIf you are using one of these older versions of Blender, however, this plug-in may still be useful to you:\n\nhttps://github.com/09th/YABEE\n\nCaution",
