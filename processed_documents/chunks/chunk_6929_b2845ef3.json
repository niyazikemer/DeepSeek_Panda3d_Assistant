How would we know that it works? Well, this shader is so simple that it basically makes our application useless and all we will see is a black screen.\n\nThe Shader\n\n//Cg\n/* lesson2.sha */\n\nvoid vshader(\n    out float4 l_position : POSITION)\n{\n    l_position = float4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n}\n\nvoid fshader(\n    out float4 o_color : COLOR)\n{\n    o_color = float4(1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0);\n}\n\nWe'll only go through the basics of this shader for now. Also note that not everything in this tutorial is a Cg requirement, some of the things such as variable names are Panda3D requirements.",
