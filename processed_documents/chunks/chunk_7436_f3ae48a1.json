There is no limit to the number of different arrays you can have within one GeomVertexData; you can make each column a separate array if you like. (There may be performance implications to consider. Some graphics drivers may work better with one block of contiguous data--one array--while others may prefer many different arrays. This performance difference is likely to be small, however.)",
