  "content": "So tex1 will contain the raw, unfitered scene. Tex2 will contain a scene that has been filtered through stage1.sha. The window will contain a scene that has been filtered through both stage1.sha and stage2.sha.\n\nThe function 'renderQuadInto' accepts the keywords 'colortex', 'auxtex0', and 'auxtex1'. It does not accept 'depthtex,' since no depth buffer is used when rendering a quad.\n\nResolution Management\n\nUnless you specify otherwise, all textures will be the same resolution as the window. The FilterManager will preserve this condition - it will automatically resize the offscreen textures if the window gets resized.\n\nThe intermediate stages created by renderQuadInto can be the same size as the window, but they can also be larger or smaller by a constant factor. The function takes the following keyword arguments:\n\nmul - The 'mul' option multiplies the size by an integer constant.\n\ndiv - The 'div' option divides the size by an integer constant.",
