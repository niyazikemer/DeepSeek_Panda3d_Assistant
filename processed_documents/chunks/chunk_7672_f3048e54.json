This is very useful for transitions or cutscenes, where it is desirable to disable user input, await a sequence of intervals, and then re-enable user input when they are done. With coroutines, this can all happen in a single function.\n\nAll tasks. When awaiting a task, it is automatically scheduled with the task manager (on the current task chain), if not already.\n\nAny .AsyncFuture object. Such an object is returned by various Panda3D operations that take a long time to complete.\n\nAny Python object that implements a suitable __await__ method.\n\nSome examples of operations that satisfy one or more of the above conditions:\n\nModel load operations, see async-loading.",
