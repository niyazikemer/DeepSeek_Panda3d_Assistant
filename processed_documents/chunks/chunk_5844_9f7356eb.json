Then, your camera will render whatever models you put into the same scene graph. In this case, since your camera is not a child of base.camera, it will be up to you to position the camera and the models correctly relative to each other.\n\npython\n\n# View some other scene, unrelated to render\nrender2 = NodePath('render2')  # the string parameter is important\ncamNP.reparentTo(render2)\nenv = loader.loadModel('environment.egg')\nenv.reparentTo(render2)\n\ncpp",
