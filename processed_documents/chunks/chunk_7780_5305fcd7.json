  "content": "You can read Panda3D's License.\n\nWho is Working on Panda3D\n\nThere are a number of developers in the commercial and open-source community. Currently, besides the active contributions from the open-source community, the most active member of the development community is Disney. Disney's primary interest in Panda3D is commercial. Panda3D is being used in the development of a number of Disney games and amusement-park exhibits. To serve Disney's needs, Panda3D must be a fully-featured engine, capable of all the performance and quality one expects in any 'A-grade' commercial title.\n\nThe most supported language is Python. Though you can use C++ too, the documentation is mostly aimed at Python use.\n\nThe Introductory Chapter\n\nThis introductory chapter of the manual is designed to walk you through some of the basics of using Panda3D. This chapter is structured as a tutorial, not as a reference work.\n\ninstallation-windows installation-linux preparation running-your-program tutorial/index",
