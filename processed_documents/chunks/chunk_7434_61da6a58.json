  "content": "Vertices are always numbered beginning at 0, and continue to the number of rows in the table (minus 1).\n\nNot all GeomVertexData objects will use these same four columns; some will have fewer columns, and some will have more. In fact, all columns, except for \"vertex\", which stores the vertex position, are optional.\n\nThe order of the columns is not meaningful, but the column names are. There are certain column names that are reserved for Panda, and instruct Panda what the meaning of each column is. For instance, the vertex position column is always named \"vertex\", and the lighting normal column, if it is present, must be named \"normal\". See geomvertexformat for the complete list of reserved column names.",
