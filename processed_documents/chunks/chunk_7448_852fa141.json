  "content": "Collision Traversers\n\nA .CollisionTraverser object performs the actual work of checking all solid objects for collisions. Normally, you will create a single CollisionTraverser object and assign it to base.cTrav; this traverser will automatically be run every frame. It is also possible to create additional CollisionTraversers if you have unusual needs; for instance, to run a second pass over a subset of the geometry. If you create additional CollisionTraversers, you must run them yourself.\n\nThe CollisionTraverser maintains a list of the active objects in the world, sometimes called the \"colliders\" or \"from objects\". The remaining collidable objects in the world that are not added to a CollisionTraverser are the \"into objects\". Each of the \"from objects\" is tested for collisions with all other objects in the world, including the other from objects as well as the into objects.",
