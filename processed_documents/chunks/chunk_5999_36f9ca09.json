  "content": "DirectLabel\n\nLabels are like buttons, but they do not respond to mouse-clicks. This means a DirectLabel is basically just a text string, and in that respect is similar to onscreentext, except that the DirectLabel integrates better with the rest of the DirectGUI system (and the constructor accepts more DirectGUI-like options).\n\nIf you are making a text label to appear on a DirectFrame or in conjunction with DirectGUI somehow, you should probably use a DirectLabel. For all other uses of text, you would probably be better off using onscreentext or a making a plain text-node instead.\n\nDirectLabel's only unique keyword can be used if you want to create a label with multiple states. If you set the value of activeState to a nonexistent state, the label will disappear, since the default state is undefined.\n\nKeyword Definition Value activeState The \u201cactive\u201d or normal state of the label Number",
