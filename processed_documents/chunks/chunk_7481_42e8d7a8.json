  "content": "Unlike a strip chart, a piano roll chart does not show trends; the chart shows only the current frame's data. The horizontal axis shows time within the frame, and the individual collectors are stacked up in an arbitrary ordering along the vertical axis.\n\nThe time spent within the frame is drawn from left to right; at any given time, the collector(s) that are active will be drawn with a horizontal bar. You can observe the CPU behavior within a frame by reading the graph from left to right. You may find it useful to select \"pause\" from the Speed pulldown menu to freeze the graph on just one frame while you read it.",
