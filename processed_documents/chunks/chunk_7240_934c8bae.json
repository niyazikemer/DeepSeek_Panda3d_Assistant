This page only exists for advanced users who need to manipulate the reference count for low-level integration with C++ code.\n\nThe class that manages the reference count is .ReferenceCount. To see if a class is reference counted, check if it inherits from ReferenceCount. C++ classes that are reference counted inherit from either .ReferenceCount or .TypedReferenceCount (if use of the typing system is desired), or another class that itself inherits from .ReferenceCount.\n\nManaging Reference Counts\n\nThere are several ways that the reference count can be manipulated in code. To get the number of references to an object, use the ~.ReferenceCount.get_ref_count() method.",
