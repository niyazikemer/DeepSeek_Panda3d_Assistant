  "content": "The two methods ~.NodePath.find and ~.NodePath.find_all_matches will return a ~.NodePath and a ~.NodePathCollection respectively. These methods require a path string as an argument. Searches can be based on name or type. In its simplest form this path consists of a series of node names separated by slashes, like a directory pathname. When creating the string each component may optionally consist of one of the following special names, instead of a node name.\n\n* Matches exactly one node of any name ** Matches any sequence of zero or more nodes +typename Matches any node that is or derives from the given type -typename Matches any node that is the given type exactly =tag Matches any node that has the indicated tag =tag=value Matches any node whose tag matches the indicated value",
