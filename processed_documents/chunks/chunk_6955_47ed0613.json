  "content": "In OpenGL, \"clip space\" and \"API clip space\" are equivalent.\n\nSupplying Translation Matrices to a Shader\n\nYou can use a shader parameter named \"trans_x_to_y\" to automatically obtain a matrix that converts any coordinate system to any other. The words x and y can be \"model,\" \"world,\" \"view,\" \"apiview,\" \"clip,\" or \"apiclip.\" Using this notation, you can build up almost any transform matrix that you might need. Here is a short list of popular matrices that can be recreated using this syntax. Of course, this isn't even close to exhaustive: there are seven keywords, so there are 7x7 possible matrices, of which 7 are the identity matrix.",
