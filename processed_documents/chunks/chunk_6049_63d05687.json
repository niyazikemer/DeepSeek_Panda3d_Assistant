  "content": "Known Shader Bugs and Limitations\n\nHere is a list of known issues in the shader system, with workarounds:\n\nProblem: No Cg Shaders on ARM Platforms\n\nProblem: Cg shaders, including the shader generator and CommonFilters, don't work on ARM-based machines, such as Apple Silicon computers.\n\nWorkaround: The NVIDIA Cg Toolkit is not available for the arm64 architecture. If you need to target Apple Silicon computers or other ARM-based machines, use GLSL shaders. This will be remedied in Panda3D 1.11, but it is nonetheless recommended to migrate to GLSL as Cg will be deprecated in a future version.\n\nProblem: GLSL Versions on macOS\n\nProblem: On macOS, loading a GLSL shader newer than 1.20 will fail, even if the hardware is capable of higher versions.",
