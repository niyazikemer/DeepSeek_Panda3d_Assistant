  "content": "\"Cull\" and \"Draw\" are the two phases of Panda's main rendering engine. Once your application code finishes executing for the frame, then Cull takes over. The name \"Cull\" implies view-frustum culling, and this is part of it; but it is also much more. This phase includes all processing of the scene graph needed to identify the objects that are going to be rendered this frame and their current state, and all processing needed to place them into an ordered list for drawing. Cull typically also includes the time to compute character animations. The output of Cull is a sorted list of objects and their associated states to be sent to the graphics card.",
