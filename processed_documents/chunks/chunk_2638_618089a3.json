  "content": "def request(self, request, *args):\n        \"\"\"Requests a state transition (or other behavior).  The\n        request may be denied by the FSM's filter function.  If it is\n        denied, the filter function may either raise an exception\n        (`RequestDenied`), or it may simply return None, without\n        changing the FSM's state.\n\n        The request parameter should be a string.  The request, along\n        with any additional arguments, is passed to the current\n        filterState() function.  If filterState() returns a string,\n        the FSM transitions to that state.\n\n        The return value is the same as the return value of\n        filterState() (that is, None if the request does not provoke a\n        state transition, otherwise it is a tuple containing the name\n        of the state followed by any optional args.)",
