Setting this smaller than 1.0 will collect fewer states\neach frame, which may require less processing time, but risks getting\nunstable cache performance if states accumulate faster than they can be\ncleaned up. geom-cache-min-frames int 1 Specifies the minimum number of frames any one particular object\nwill remain in the geom cache, even if geom-cache-size is exceeded. geom-cache-size int 5000 Specifies the maximum number of entries in the cache for storing\npre-processed data for rendering vertices. This limit is flexible, and\nmay be temporarily exceeded if many different Geoms are pre-processed\nduring the space of a single frame. geomipterrain-incorrect-normals bool 0 If true, uses the incorrect normal vector calculation that was used\nin Panda3D versions 1.9 and earlier.
