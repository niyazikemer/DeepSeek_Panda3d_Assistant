  "content": "Matrix Representation\n\nPeriodically, the question arises: does Panda store matrices in column-major or row-major format? Unfortunately, people who ask that question often fail to realize that there are four ways to represent matrices, two of which are called \"column major,\" and two of which are called \"row major.\" So the answer to the question is not very useful. This section explains the four possible ways to represent matrices, and then explains which one panda uses.\n\nThe Problem\n\nIn graphics, matrices are mainly used to transform vertices. So one way to write a matrix is to write the four transform equations that it represents. Assuming that the purpose of a matrix is to transform an input-vector $\\begin{pmatrix}x_i&y_i&z_i&w_i\\end{pmatrix}$ into an output vector $\\begin{pmatrix}x_o&y_o&z_o&w_o\\end{pmatrix}$, the four equations are:",
