The fields marked \"required\" or \"ram\" will be\n        broadcast to all of the other clients; if you wish to\n        broadcast additional field values at this time as well, pass a\n        list of field names in the optionalFields parameters.\n\n        Normally, doId is None, to mean allocate a new doId for the\n        object.  If you wish to use a particular doId, pass it in\n        here.  If you also pass reserveDoId = True, this doId will be\n        reserved from the allocation pool using self.reserveDoId().\n        You are responsible for ensuring this doId falls within the\n        client's allowable doId range and has not already been\n        assigned to another object.  \"\"\"",
