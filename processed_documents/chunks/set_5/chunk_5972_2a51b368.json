This enables Python to interface more easily with Panda's virtual file system, and it also better-supports Panda's SIMPLE_THREADS model, by avoiding blocking all threads while waiting for I/O to complete.\n\nBesides the ~direct.stdpy.file.open() call, this module also contains replacements for various other functions provided by the Python os and os.path modules. See the API reference page <direct.stdpy.file> for a full listing.\n\nNote\n\nThis section is incomplete.",
