  "content": "Setting the film size defines the units to be used for some of the other advanced lens properties, such as the focal length (below) and the lens offset. For instance, a 35mm camera exposes a rectangle on the film about 24mm x 36mm, so if you wanted to simulate a 35mm camera, you would use lens.set_film_size(24, 36) <.Lens.set_film_size>. This establishes that your film units are in millimeters, so you could then specify a lens with a focal length of 50mm using lens.set_focal_length(50) <.Lens.set_focal_length>. (Setting both the film size and the focal length like this would automatically calculate the field of view; see below.)",
