  "content": "Note that you will have to define both HAVE_THREADS and SIMPLE_THREADS at the same time to enable the simple interface, or you will not have threading.\n\nThe public builds enable true threading by default, so you will not need to build Panda3D yourself if you want to take advantage of true threading.\n\nIf you wish to disable threading, you can pass the option --override HAVE_THREADS=UNDEF to makepanda.py. If you wish to use the simple threading model, you may pass --override SIMPLE_THREADS=1 instead.\n\nDebugging Threading Bugs\n\nDue to the nature of threading-related bugs, it can be very difficult to track down the source of a problem if a piece of code is crashing due to a threading problem. It may be useful to recompile Panda3D with the DEBUG_THREADS=1 option enabled. This will enable various debug checking tools that will alert you of incorrect use of threading, rather than crashing. However, there is a significant performance cost associated with this option.",
