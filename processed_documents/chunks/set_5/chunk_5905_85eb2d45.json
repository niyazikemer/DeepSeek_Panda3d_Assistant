  "content": "F. This distance is the focal length of the lens. Like film size, this is only an abstract concept in Panda3D, but it is a very important concept in a real, physical camera. Technically, it is the distance between a lens's nodal point or camera plane and its focal plane or film plane, and it affects the field of view of the lens. In real photography, lenses are typically described by their focal length, rather than by their field of view. You can set the focal length via lens.set_focal_length(distance) <.Lens.set_focal_length>.",
