  "content": "But because BAM files are a reflection of the internal memory structure of Panda3D, it's theoretically possible for a BAM file created using one version of Panda3D to no longer work in a future version of Panda3D. Therefore, if you choose to work directly with BAM files, you should make sure to always preserve the source assets and information about the pipeline so that you can reconvert the model as needed.\n\nBecause it is such an efficient format, it is very well-suited for shipping with a copy of a game for end-users. This allows the finished game to load models very quickly, and the plug-ins for loading models can be excluded. This format is very well-suited for shipping with a copy of a game for end-users, with the further advantage that the additional plug-ins do not need to be included with the installed game. The distribution tools therefore automatically convert files to the BAM format.",
