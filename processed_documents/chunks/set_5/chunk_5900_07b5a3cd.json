  "content": "C. This distance is called the near distance or near plane of the lens. Objects that are closer than this to the camera plane will not be rendered. You may set the near distance as small as you like, but it must be greater than 0; and the smaller you set it, the greater the likelihood that you will observe an artifact called Z-fighting, a shimmering of objects that are off in the distance. The default near distance is 1.0, which for many scenes is a reasonable compromise. Of course, the most appropriate value for your scene depends on the nature of the scene (as well as the measurement units in which your scene is modeled).\n\nYou may change the near distance at any time with the call lens.set_near(distance) <.Lens.set_near>.",
