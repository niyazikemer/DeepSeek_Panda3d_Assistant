  "content": "You may specify a subrange that is longer than the actual animation, but if you do so, you probably also want to specify either loop=1 or constrainedLoop=1; see below.\n\nThe loop parameter is a boolean value. When it is true, it means that the animation restarts and plays again if the interval extends beyond the animation's last frame. When it is false, it means that the animation stops and holds its final pose when the interval extends beyond the animation's last frame. Note that, in neither case, will the ActorInterval loop indefinitely: all intervals always have a specific, finite duration, and the duration of an ActorInterval is controlled by either the duration parameter, the startTime/endTime parameters, or the startFrame/endFrame parameters. Setting loop=1 has no effect on the duration of the ActorInterval, it only controls what the actor does if you try to play past the end of the animation.",
