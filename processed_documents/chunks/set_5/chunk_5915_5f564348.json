  "content": "There may be many scene graphs in an application. In fact, any tree of nodes in existence is technically a scene graph all on its own. But for the purposes of rendering 3D models, we usually talk about the standard 3D scene graph, at the root of which is a node called ~builtins.render.\n\nPanda3D also creates a scene graph for rendering 2D objects. This is used for putting text, images and GUI elements on top of the 3D scene. This scene graph is positioned under a root called ~builtins.render2d, but this will be explained further in a later section <gui>.\n\nWhat you Need to Know about the Hierarchical Scene Graph\n\nHere are the most important things you need to know about the hierarchical arrangement of the scene graph:\n\nYou control where objects go in the tree. When you insert an object into the tree, you specify where to insert it. You can move branches of the tree around. You can make the tree as deep or as shallow as you like.",
