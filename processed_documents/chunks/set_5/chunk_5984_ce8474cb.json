  "content": "\"Put groups of objects that the programmer will have to deal with in a special way under a single node.\"\n\nFor instance, if there's a section of an environment that will be hidden during some point in the game, put that entire section under a single node. The programmer might also like certain classes of collision solids to be under a single node.\n\n\"Don't use lossy compression (i.e. jpeg) for textures.\"\n\nAlthough jpegs save space on disk, they also degrade your beautiful textures! If textures have to be manipulated later (i.e. downgraded), this degradation will only be compounded. Every time you edit and resave a jpeg, the image quality gets worse. Jpegs may need to be used in the finished product, but it's always best to make this conversion the last step in the process, not the first one. I recommend using the png format, which provides lossless compression and full support for all color depths as well as alpha.",
