  "content": "Texturing\n\nAt its simplest, texturing merely consists of applying a texture in your modeling program. When you export the model, the path to the texture and some options for it like filtering or repeat-method (see next pages) are saved into the egg file. The texture paths can be either relative (as seen from the egg file) or absolute (full path). See filename-syntax for more info about Panda's filename syntax. In most cases the relative path makes more sense.\n\nPanda can load JPG, PNG, TIF, and a number of other file formats.\n\nMore advanced texturing methods are described in the following sections.",
