  "content": "If you are writing a program to generate Egg files, either approach is equally good. However, if you are writing a program to parse Egg files, we do recommend using the panda runtime library, rather than writing your own parser, for the simple reason that it is difficult to write a parser that accepts all valid Egg files. Also, the Egg syntax might be extended from time to time, and relying on the runtime library to parse the Egg syntax will ensure that your program continues to parse future Egg files.",
