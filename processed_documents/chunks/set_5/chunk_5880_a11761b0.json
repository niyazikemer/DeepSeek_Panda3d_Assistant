  "content": "Ambient Lights\n\nAn ambient light is used to fill in the shadows on the dark side of an object, so it doesn't look completely black. The light from an ambient light is uniformly distributed everywhere in the world, so the ambient light's position and orientation are irrelevant.\n\nUsually you don't want to create an ambient light without also creating one of the other kinds of lights, since an object illuminated solely by ambient light will be completely flat shaded and you won't be able to see any of its details. Typically, ambient lights are given a fairly dark gray color, so they don't overpower the other lights in the scene.\n\nalight = AmbientLight('alight')\nalight.setColor((0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1))\nalnp = render.attachNewNode(alight)\nrender.setLight(alnp)\n\nSpotlights",
