  "content": "Simple Environment Mapping\n\nThere is a classic technique in real-time computer graphics for making objects appear shiny or reflective. It's called environment mapping or sometimes reflection mapping or, in this case, sphere mapping.\n\nEnvironment mapping is not ray tracing. But it's a cheesy way to get a similar effect. The idea for both of them is that, mathematically, it's easy to calculate the direction from which a ray of light must have been coming before it bounced off a particular point of a shiny object and entered your eye. If the renderer were using ray tracing, it would follow this ray, for each point on your shiny object, backwards from your eye, and determine what object in the environment the ray came from; and that's what you'd see in the reflection.",
