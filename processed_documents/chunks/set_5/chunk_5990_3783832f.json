But when building an application <distribution>, build_apps can automatically add these special symbols. Simply add this option to the build_apps options block in setup.py:\n\n'prefer_discrete_gpu': True,\n\nThis option is available as of Panda3D 1.10.13.\n\ncpp\n\nSimply copy-paste the following symbols into the source file containing your main entry point:",
