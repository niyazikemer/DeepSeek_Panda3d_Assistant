  "content": "The equations above contain sixteen coefficients. Those coefficients are derivatives. For example, the coefficient \"G\" could also be called \"the derivative of yo with respect to zi.\"\n\nThis gives us a handy way to refer to groups of coefficients. Collectively, the coefficients \"A,B,C,D\" could also be called \"the derivatives of xo with respect to $\\begin{pmatrix}x_i&y_i&z_i&w_i\\end{pmatrix}$\" or just \"the derivatives of xo\" for short. The coefficients \"A,E,J,N\" could also be called \"the derivatives of $\\begin{pmatrix}x_o&y_o&z_o&w_o\\end{pmatrix}$ with respect to xi\" or just \"the derivatives with respect to xi\" for short.\n\nThis is a good way to refer to groups of four coefficients because it unambiguously names four of them without reference to which storage option or which typesetting option you choose.",
