  "content": "class MotionTrail(NodePath, DirectObject):\n    \"\"\"Generates smooth geometry-based motion trails behind a moving object.\n\n    To use this class, first define the shape of the cross-section polygon that\n    is to be extruded along the motion trail by calling `add_vertex()` and\n    `set_vertex_color()`.  When this is done, call `update_vertices()`.\n\n    To generate the motion trail, either call `register_motion_trail()`\n    to have Panda update it automatically, or periodically call the method\n    `update_motion_trail()` with the current time and the new transform.\n\n    The duration of the sample history is specified by `time_window`.  A larger\n    time window creates longer motion trails (given constant speed).  Samples\n    that are no longer within the time window are automatically discarded.",
