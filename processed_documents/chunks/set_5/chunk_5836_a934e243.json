  "content": "Custom .egg Readers/Writers\n\nWhen writing an importer or exporter for panda, you have two choices.\n\nOne option is to use the panda runtime library, which includes code for reading, parsing, storing, and emitting Egg files. This approach can save you a great deal of effort. However, it does require that you link with the panda runtime system, which may be inconvenient if you wish to distribute a small, standalone file translator.\n\nIf you decide to use the panda runtime system, the classes you will need to use are defined in the panda3d.egg module, such as .EggData, .EggGroup, and so forth. Like all Panda3D classes, these are documented in the API reference <reference>.\n\nThe other alternative is to parse/generate the Egg file entirely by yourself. In this case, you will need to read the egg-syntax documentation. The file format is human-readable, and fairly straightforward.",
