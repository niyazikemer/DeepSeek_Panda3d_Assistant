  "content": "Model Files\n\nThe most common way to put geometry in the scene is by loading it from a file. A model file contains a tree of nodes, similar to a scene graph, under which the actual geometry is stored that Panda3D can render to the screen.\n\nModel files can contain static geometry, but they can also contain information for animating the model, as well as information about the model's material, ie. what color the material has, and how this color changes under the influence of lighting.\n\nPanda does not distinguish between big stuff and small stuff. For example, if a virtual world contains a coffee cup on a table, and the table is in the middle of a small island, then the coffee cup, the table, and the island are all models: each is a piece of static non-animated geometry. A model file could also contain the entire island with all the smaller models included within it.",
