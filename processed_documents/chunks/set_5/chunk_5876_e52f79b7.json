This method is deprecated and may be removed in a future version of Panda3D. By default, the specular color of a light is automatically set from its regular color.\n\nNote\n\nThe R, G, B values can be larger than 1, if you want brighter lights! In fact, to achieve a realistic look, you may need to set your light colors many orders of magnitude higher than \"full white\", and use HDR rendering techniques (described in common-image-filters) to make sure that the full dynamic range of your lights can be adequately represented and compressed down to the range that the user's monitor can display.\n\nPoint Lights",
