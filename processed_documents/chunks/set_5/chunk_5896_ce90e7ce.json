  "content": "There are several different properties that can be set on a PerspectiveLens. Not all of them are independent; setting some properties will change the values of other properties. Here is an illustration:\n\nA. This point is the nodal point or eyepoint of the lens. It is also (usually) the origin, that is, the (0, 0, 0) point of the camera that holds the lens. Normally (in a default Z-up coordinate system), the lens will be looking down the +Y axis, so in the above illustration the +Y axis extends to the right from point A. The plane containing the nodal point, perpendicular the viewing direction (that is, the plane corresponding to the vertical line through point A), is called the camera plane.",
