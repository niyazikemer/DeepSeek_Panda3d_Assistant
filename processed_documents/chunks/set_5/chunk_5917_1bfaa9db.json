  "content": "Beginners usually choose to make their tree completely flat--everything is inserted immediately beneath the root. This is actually a very good initial design. Eventually, you will find a reason to want to add a little more depth to the hierarchy. But it is wise not to get complicated until you have a clear, specific reason to do so.\n\nNodePaths\n\nMost manipulations of the scene graph are performed using the .NodePath class. This is a very small object containing a pointer to a node, plus some administrative information. For now, you can ignore the administrative information; it will be explained in a later section <instancing> of the manual. It is the intent of the Panda3D designers that you should think of a NodePath as a handle to a node. Any function that creates a node returns a .NodePath that refers to the newly-created node.",
