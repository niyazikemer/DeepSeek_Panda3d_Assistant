Use the ~.Lens.set_near_far() method on the Lens to get a perfect fit of what is being rendered. Also, for directional lights, you will need to call ~.Lens.set_film_size() on the Lens and position the light properly so that the light camera will get an optimal view of the scene.\n\nAlso note that every Light is in fact also a Camera, so you can easily exclude objects from being shadowed (e.g. for performance reasons) by use of camera masks.",
