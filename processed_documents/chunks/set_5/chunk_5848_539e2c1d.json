  "content": "Fortunately for you, our prepackaged copies of Panda3D are already carefully matched. For example, our Panda3D for Ubuntu is already perfectly matched to the Python interpreter that comes with that version of Ubuntu. So normally, you don't need to worry about this at all.\n\nIf your Linux Distribution is not listed, you will need to build your own copy of Panda3D. The build process will automatically create a copy of Panda3D which perfectly matches your Linux Distribution's Python interpreter. This is easy to do, but it does require a time-consuming compile. On the other hand, trying to use an RPM or a DEB from some other Distribution is very unlikely to work, because of this need for an exact feature-for-feature match between the Python package (Panda3D) and the Python interpreter.",
