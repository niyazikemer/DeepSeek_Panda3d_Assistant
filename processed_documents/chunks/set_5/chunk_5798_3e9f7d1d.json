  "content": "Ray tracing is still too computation-intensive to be done in real time. But a reflection vector is easy to calculate per-vertex, and if we could turn a reflection vector into a (u, v) texture coordinate pair, the graphics hardware is particularly good at looking up the color in a texture image that corresponds to that (u, v) pair. So all we need is an image that shows the objects in our environment.\n\nIn sphere mapping, the 3-D reflection vector is turned into a 2-D texture coordinate pair by mathematically applying a spherical distortion. This means the environment map should be a view of the world as seen through a 360-degree fisheye lens, or as reflected in a shiny ball like a holiday ornament. You can see why it is called sphere mapping.\n\nPanda3D can generate sphere maps for you. The above sphere map was generated with the following code:",
