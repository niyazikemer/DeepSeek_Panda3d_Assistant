  "content": "From that point forward, playing the audio will cause the texture to update. This is more accurate than synchronizing the video manually.\n\nFor powers-of-two limited graphics hardware\n\nIf your graphics hardware does not support non power-of-two textures, your movie texture size would be shifted up to the next larger power of two size. For example, if you have a movie of 640 x 360 in size, the generated texture would be actually 1024 x 512. The result is a texture that contains a movie in the lower-left corner, and a black pad region to the right and upper portion of the texture.\n\nTo work around this limit, you have to display just the lower-left portion of the texture. To see a complete demonstration of this process, see the Media Player sample program.\n\nIssues\n\nThe video texture works by decoding on a frame by frame basis and copying into the texture buffer. As such, it is inadvisable to use more than a few high res video textures at the same time.",
