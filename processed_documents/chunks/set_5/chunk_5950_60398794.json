See the task-chains page for more information.\n\nThreading\n\nIf you want to use threading with Panda3D, it's not recommended to use Python's built-in threading modules, since you will most likely run into issues (for Panda3D is written in C++ and thus does not use the Python threading modules). However, Panda3D offers a threading implementation that is safe to use, by reimplementing Python's \"thread\" and \"threading\" modules, these work the same as the Python built-in threading modules but are actually safe to use with Panda3D.\n\nYou can get access to Panda3D's implementation of Python's thread module by importing the ~direct.stdpy.thread module from direct.stdpy:\n\n# WRONG:\nimport thread\n# RIGHT:\nfrom direct.stdpy import thread",
