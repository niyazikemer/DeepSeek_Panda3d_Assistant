That means that\n        nowadays, this Python method will probably never be called,\n        since UPDATE_FIELD messages will not even be passed to the\n        Python message handlers.  But this method remains for\n        documentation purposes, and also as a \"just in case\" handler\n        in case we ever do come across a situation in the future in\n        which python might handle the UPDATE_FIELD message.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Get the DO Id\n        doId = di.getUint32()\n\n        ovUpdated = self.__doUpdateOwner(doId, di)\n\n        if doId in self.deferredDoIds:\n            # This object hasn't really been generated yet.
