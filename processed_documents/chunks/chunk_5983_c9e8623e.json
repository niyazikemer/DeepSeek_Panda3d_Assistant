  "content": "\"Check your model in pview before handing it off.\"\n\nThe biggest delays in the pipeline come from the back and forth iterations between artist and programmer. A quick check with pview will often find missing textures, backward facing polygons, incorrect normals, mis-tagged collision solids, and a host of other problems.\n\n\"Build models with good hierarchy, and don't change the hierarchy unnecessarily.\"\n\nA well organized hierarchy can make a model much easier for a programmer to work with, and can also have a significant effect on rendering performance. For rendering purposes, good hierarchies group objects that are close to each other together, and don't have more than a few hundred to a few thousand triangles (depending on the target hardware) in each node. (Low-end hardware performs better with only a few hundred triangles per node; high-end hardware performs better with several thousand triangles per node.)",
