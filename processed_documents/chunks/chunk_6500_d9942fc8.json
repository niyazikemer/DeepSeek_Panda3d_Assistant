  "content": "Tasks\n\nTasks are special functions that are called once each frame while your application executes. They are similar in concept to threads. However, in Panda3D, tasks are not generally separate threads; instead, all tasks are run cooperatively, one at a time, within the main thread. This design simplifies game programming considerably by removing the requirement to protect critical sections of code from mutual access. (See task-chains in the next section if you really want to use threading.)\n\npython\n\nWhen you start Panda3D by initializing ShowBase, a handful of tasks are created by default, but you are free to add as many additional tasks as you like.\n\ncpp\n\nWhen you start Panda3D by initializing WindowFramework, a handful of tasks are created by default, but you are free to add as many additional tasks as you like.\n\nThe Task Function",
