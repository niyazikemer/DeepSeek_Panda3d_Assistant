  "content": "Patching\n\nPatching is a process of generating the difference between 2 files:\n\np = Patchfile()\np.build('version_1.mf', 'version_2.mf', 'v1_to_v2.patch')\n\nThis will generate the file v1_to_v2.patch based on the differences between version_1.mf and version_2.mf. Then when you have version_1.mf and v1_to_v2.patch, you can produce version_2.mf with:\n\np = Patchfile()\np.apply(Filename('v1_to_v2.patch'), Filename('version_1.mf'))\n\nThere are other, more esoteric options, for limiting memory usage during patching, or for patching in increments instead of all at once so you can update a progress bar.\n\nIn the example above the files are named *.mf. This example suggests that you might be patching files in Panda's Multifile format (*.mf). The multifiles can store multiple resources like bams, textures, mp3's, and so on, and Panda can load them from directly from the multifiles without having to unpack them first.",
