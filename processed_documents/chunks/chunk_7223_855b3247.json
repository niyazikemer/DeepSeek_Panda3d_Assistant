  "content": "A particular advantage of this format is its support for PBR (physically-based rendering) materials, which are better supported with glTF than with Egg, although at the moment you will need a custom shader or a third-party add-on such as panda3d-simplepbr to render these materials correctly. glTF is also the format of choice when exporting models from Blender 2.80 and above, as explained here <converting-from-blender>.\n\nInstalling the Plug-In\n\nThere are two ways to load glTF files. By default, Panda3D will load glTF files via the Assimp plug-in <assimp-loader>, but the quality of its converter is not very good. Instead, there is a high quality third-party plug-in for this purpose called panda3d-gltf. It can be installed by typing the following pip command:\n\npython -m pip install -U panda3d-gltf\n\npython",
