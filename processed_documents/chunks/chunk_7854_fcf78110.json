  "content": "Panda3D provides three classes for terrain generation and LOD handling:\n\nThe HeightfieldTesselator <heightfield-tesselator>. This class can take a grayscale height field image and generate a terrain. It uses a linear LOD system, and, of course, because when the camera moves away from the focal point, the terrain needs to be regenerated to 'focus' on the new focal point. On extremely large terrains, this might lead to complications, because regenerating the entire terrain takes time, and the player might experience some lag when it is regenerated. That is why this class is not very suitable for extremely large terrains.",
