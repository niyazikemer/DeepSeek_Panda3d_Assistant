  "content": "Also, note that almost all of these options have a very narrow purpose; you would generally use most of these only to perform the particular effect that they were designed for. This manual will discuss these special-purpose TexGen modes in later sections, as each effect is discussed; for now, you only need to understand that they exist, and not worry about exactly what they do.\n\nThe mode that is most likely to have general utility is the first one: MWorldPosition. This mode converts each vertex's (x, y, z) position into world space, and then copies those three numeric values to the (u, v, w) texture coordinates. This means, for instance, that if you apply a normal 2-D texture to the object, the object's (x, y) position will be used to look up colors in the texture.",
