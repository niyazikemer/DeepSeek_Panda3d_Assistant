  "content": "Task Chains\n\nWhen you add tasks to the TaskManager, you are actually adding them to the default Task Chain. The TaskManager maintains one or more task chains; each chain is a list of tasks that are available to be executed.\n\nYou are free to create additional task chains as you see the need. Normally, though, there is no reason to have more than the default task chain, unless you wish to take advantage of threaded tasks: each task chain has the option of being serviced by one or more sub-threads, which allows the tasks on that chain to run in parallel with (or at a lower priority than) the main tasks.",
