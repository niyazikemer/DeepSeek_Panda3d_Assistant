Task.cont Perform the task again next frame. Task.again Perform the task again, using the same delay as initially\nspecified.\n\ncpp\n\nVariable Purpose AsyncTask::DS_done Specifies that a task is finished and removes it from the task\nmanager. AsyncTask::DS_cont Perform the task again next frame. AsyncTask::DS_again Perform the task again, using the same delay as initially\nspecified.\n\nThe Do-Later Task\n\ncpp\n\nIf you have used Panda3D in Python, you might be familiar with the Python function taskMgr.doMethodLater(), which lets you schedule a task to be started after a certain delay. This isn't needed in C++, because you can set a delay on a task directly with task->set_delay(). An example will be provided below in the task manager section.\n\npython",
