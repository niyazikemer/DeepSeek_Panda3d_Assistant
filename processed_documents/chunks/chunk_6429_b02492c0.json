While it can be defined beforehand, it does not have to be.\n\ndelay = Wait(2.5)\npandaWalkSeq =\n    Sequence(\n        Parallel(pandaWalk, pandaWalkAnim),\n        delay,\n        Parallel(pandaWalkBack, pandaWalkAnim),\n        Wait(1.0),\n        Func(myFunction, arg1)\n    )\n\nIn the above example, a wait interval is generated. After that, a Sequence is made that uses a Parallel, the defined wait interval, another Parallel, and a wait interval, and a call to the function function myFunction is generated in the Sequence. Such Sequences can get very long very quick, so it may be prudent to define the internal Parallels and Sequences before creating the master Sequence.\n\nOne can do very powerful things with Sequences and Parallels.
