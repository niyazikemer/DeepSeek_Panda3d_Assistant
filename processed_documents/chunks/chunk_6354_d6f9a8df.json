  "content": "You can also take a look at ~panda3d.core.MeshDrawer2D.\n\nIt follows a similar pattern as MeshDrawer but has stuff that is useful to draw in 2d. Major differences is that its begin() takes no arguments and it deals mostly with rectangles and borders around them. It also has a setClip function which clips rectangles as they are drawn. This is very useful to draw rectangles that appear to be inside other rectangles and be clipped by their parents. It has only the low level abstraction on which you would have to build your own UI components, or you can take a look at TreeGUI.",
