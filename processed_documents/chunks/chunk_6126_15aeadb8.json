  "content": "The bloom filter has many keyword parameters:\n\nblend - The bloom filter needs to measure the brightness of each pixel. It does this by weighting the R,G,B, and A components. Default weights: (0.3,0.4,0.3,0.0). You should assign a nonzero weight to the alpha channel if you want the glow map to have an effect, or a value like (0, 0, 0, 1) if you only want your glow map to indicate which models should glow.\n\nmintrigger - Minimum brightness at which a halo is generated. Default: 0.6\n\nmaxtrigger - Maximum brightness at which the halo reaches peak intensity. Default: 1.0\n\ndesat - Degree to which the halo is desaturated. Setting this to zero means the halo is the same color as the bright pixel. Setting it to one means the halo is white. Default: 0.6\n\nintensity - An adjustment parameter for the brightness of the halos. Default: 1.0",
