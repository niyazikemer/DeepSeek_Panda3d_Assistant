  "content": "Loading the Grassy Scenery\n\nThe Scene Graph <the-scene-graph>\n\nPanda3D contains a data structure called the Scene Graph. The Scene Graph is a tree containing all objects that need to be rendered. At the root of the tree is an object named render. Nothing is rendered until it is first inserted into the Scene Graph.\n\ncpp\n\nYou can get the NodePath of render by calling window->get_render() <WindowFramework::get_render>.\n\nTo install the grassy scenery model into the Scene Graph, we use the method ~.NodePath.reparent_to(). This sets the parent of the model, thereby giving it a place in the Scene Graph. Doing so makes the model visible in the scene.\n\nFinally, we adjust the position and scale of the model. In this particular case, the environment model is a little too large and somewhat offset for our purposes. The ~.NodePath.set_scale() and ~.NodePath.set_pos() procedures rescale and center the model.",
