  "content": "Writing to a column with a GeomVertexWriter does require that the GeomVertexData's format already has the appropriate columns to handle the data you are writing (in the above example, for instance, the format must already have a 'texcoord' column, or the above code will fail). Furthermore, the columns must have the appropriate format. For instance, if you wanted to upgrade a model's texture coordinates from 2-D texture coordinates to 3-D texture coordinates, simply calling texcoord.set_data3(u, v, w) <.GeomVertexWriter.set_data3> wouldn't change the fact that the existing texcoord column is a 2-component format; you would just be trying to stuff a 3-component value into a 2-component column.",
