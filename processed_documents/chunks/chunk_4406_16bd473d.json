  "content": "If minfilter or magfilter is not None, they should be a symbol\n        like `SamplerState.FTLinear` or `SamplerState.FTNearest`.\n        (minfilter may be further one of the Mipmap filter type symbols.)\n        These specify the filter mode that will automatically be applied\n        to the texture when it is loaded.  Note that this setting may\n        override the texture's existing settings, even if it has\n        already been loaded.  See `egg-texture-cards` for a more robust\n        way to apply per-texture filter types and settings.\n\n        If anisotropicDegree is not None, it specifies the anisotropic degree\n        to apply to the texture when it is loaded.  Like minfilter and\n        magfilter, `egg-texture-cards` may be a more robust way to apply\n        this setting.",
