For instance, you can split one big polygon into a grid of little polygons, and the sorting is more likely to be accurate for each piece (because the center of the bounding volume is closer to the pixels). You can draw a picture to see how this works. In order to do this properly, you can't just make it one big mesh of small polygons, since Panda will make a mesh into a single Geom of tristrips; instead, it needs to be separate meshes, so that each one will become its own Geom. Obviously, this is slightly more expensive too, since you are introducing additional vertices and adding more objects to the sort list; so you don't want to go too crazy with the smallness of your polygons.",
