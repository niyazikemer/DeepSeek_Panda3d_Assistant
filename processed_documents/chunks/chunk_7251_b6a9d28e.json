  "content": "Absolute mouse mode\n\nBy default, the mouse is in \"absolute\" mode, meaning the cursor can freely move outside the window. This mode is typical for desktop applications.\n\nIn a first person game where the mouse controls the camera (\"mouselook\"), however, you usually want the mouse cursor to stay inside the window, so you can get movement events no matter how far the user moves the mouse.\n\nTwo other mouse modes can help with this.\n\nRelative mouse mode\n\nIn relative mode, the mouse cursor is kept at the center of the window, and only relative movement events are reported.\n\nTypically you want to hide the mouse cursor in this case, since otherwise it distractingly \"sticks\" to the center of the window.\n\ncpp\n\n// To set relative mode and hide the cursor:\nWindowProperties props = window->get_graphics_window()->get_properties();\nprops.set_cursor_hidden(true);\nprops.set_mouse_mode(WindowProperties::M_relative);\nwindow->get_graphics_window()->request_properties(props);",
