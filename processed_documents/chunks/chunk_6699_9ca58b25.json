An alternative approach is to create a pattern that includes all files, and only specify extensions to exclude using exclude_patterns.\n\nSome extensions, such as .egg, have special handlers associated with them. The handler for .egg will automatically run egg2bam to compile it into a .bam file. BAM files are smaller and load more efficiently, and allow the EGG loading plug-in to be excluded from the Panda3D build.",
