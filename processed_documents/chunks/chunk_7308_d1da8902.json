  "content": "These are what the rest of the parameters mean:\n\nIf you have multiple surfaces, you need to tell ODE which surface belongs to which geometry. You can assign surfaces to your geometry using odeSpace.setSurfaceType(geometry, surfaceId)\n\nCollision Events\n\nIt is also possible to receive an event when a collision occurs. You need to set the name of the event by doing:\n\npython\n\nspace.setCollisionEvent(\"yourCollision\")\n\ncpp\n\nspace.set_collision_event(\"yourCollision\");\n\nYou can then use this event name in an accept() call. The parameter passed to the event is an OdeCollisionEntry, which holds all the geoms and contacts in the collision. See the API Reference page for ~panda3d.ode.OdeCollisionEntry for more details.\n\nThe following code shows how it works (the methods used are not real):",
