  "content": "Texture Compression\n\nYou may be familiar with image file formats like JPEG, which can compress image data dramatically and make image files much smaller than they would be otherwise, in return for sacrificing a tiny bit of the original image quality.\n\nJPEG compression only applies to the image size on disk, however. Once you load a texture image into memory, whether it came from a JPEG, PNG, or TGA file, it always takes up the same amount of texture memory on your graphics card (based on the size of the texture).",
