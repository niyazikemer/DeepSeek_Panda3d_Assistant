You can't put anything inside them that isn't an interval. The following would have the same effect and work:\n\nmove = Sequence(Func(obj.setX, 5))\n\nThis will start the execution of the function, but not wait for it to finish.\n\nDoes Panda3D use degrees or radians?\n\nDegrees, but see also the deg2Rad() and rad2Deg() functions. But note that functions like math.sin(), math.cos(), math.tan() are calculated in radians. Don't forget to convert the values!\n\nWhy do all my flat objects look weird when lit?",
