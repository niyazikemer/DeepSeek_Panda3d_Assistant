This is because if you let it keep the default value of repeat, the color may bleed in from the opposite edge, producing a thin line along the edge of your polygon, like this:\n\nThis is a particularly common error with a texture that is painted as an alpha cutout, where there is an image with a fully transparent background: you will often see a thin, barely-visible edge floating along the top (for instance) of the polygon. This edge is actually the bottom edge of the texture bleeding onto the top, because the designer specified WM_repeat instead of the correct mode, WM_clamp.",
