  "content": "An alternative is the Rigid Body Combiner <the-rigid-body-combiner>, which can combine multiple nodes while you can still change the transforms on the sub-nodes. This still combines the nodes into a single mesh as ~.NodePath.flatten_strong() does, but uses the vertex animation system so that the individual nodes can still be moved. However, this method can come with its own performance caveats, creating strain on the animation system. It is intended to be used as a last resort.\n\nTerrain",
