  "content": "support-threads #f\n\nMulti-threaded Render Pipeline\n\nPanda's own rendering pipeline is divided up into multiple stages: App, Cull, and Draw. These stages can be executed concurrently on separate threads, which makes it possible for the next frame to start its computations before the previous frame has finished being drawn to the screen. In the best case, this means theoretically improving performance by 3x!\n\nSee the page multithreaded-render-pipeline for more information.\n\nAsynchronous Operations\n\nPanda3D provides several useful high-level functions for loading models and doing other expensive operations in a thread, so the user of your application will not notice chugs in the frame rate. These functions are managed by Panda3D automatically, so do not require knowledge of threading. It is recommended that you first seek out these features before implementing threading yourself.\n\nSee async-loading for more information about these features.\n\nTask Chains",
