  "content": "This loads a special model as a `TextFont` object, for rendering\n        text with a `TextNode`.  A font file must be either a special\n        egg file (or bam file) generated with egg-mkfont, which is\n        considered a static font, or a standard font file (like a TTF\n        file) that is supported by FreeType, which is considered a\n        dynamic font.\n\n        okMissing should be True to indicate the method should return\n        None if the font file is not found.  If it is False, the\n        method will raise an exception if the font file is not found\n        or cannot be loaded.\n\n        Most font-customization parameters accepted by this method\n        (except lineHeight and spaceAdvance) may only be specified for\n        dynamic font files like TTF files, not for static egg files.",
