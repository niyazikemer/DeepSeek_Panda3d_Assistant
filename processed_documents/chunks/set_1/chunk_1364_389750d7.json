  "content": "Groups allow option specifications that apply to all members of the group.\n    If a widget has components: 'text1', 'text2', and 'text3' which all belong\n    to the 'text' group, they can be all configured with keywords of the form:\n    'text_keyword' (e.g. ``text_font='comic.rgb'``).  A component's group\n    is stored as the fourth element of its entry in self.__componentInfo.\n\n    Note: the widget constructors have access to all remaining keywords in\n    _constructorKeywords (those not transferred to _optionInfo by\n    define/addoptions).  If a component defines an alias that applies to\n    one of the keywords, that keyword is replaced with a new keyword with\n    the alias expanded.",
