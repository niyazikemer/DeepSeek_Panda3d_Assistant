  "content": "Notes:\n\n    - constructor keywords override the defaults.\n    - derived class default values override parent class defaults\n    - derived class handler functions override parent class functions\n\n4)  Superclass initialization methods are called (resulting in nested calls\n    to define options (see 2 above)\n\n5)  Widget components are created via calls to\n    :func:`~DirectGuiBase.createcomponent`.  User can specify aliases and groups\n    for each component created.\n\n    Aliases are alternate names for components, e.g. a widget may have a\n    component with a name 'entryField', which itself may have a component\n    named 'entry', you could add an alias 'entry' for the 'entryField_entry'\n    These are stored in self.__componentAliases.  If an alias is found,\n    all keyword entries which use that alias are expanded to their full\n    form (to avoid conversion later)",
