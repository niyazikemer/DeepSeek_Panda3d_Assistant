Handles composite widgets and\ncommand line argument parsing.\n\nCode overview:\n\n1)  Each widget defines a set of options (optiondefs) as a list of tuples\n    of the form ``('name', defaultValue, handler)``.\n    'name' is the name of the option (used during construction of configure)\n    handler can be: None, method, or INITOPT.  If a method is specified, it\n    will be called during widget construction (via initialiseoptions), if the\n    Handler is specified as an INITOPT, this is an option that can only be set\n    during widget construction.\n\n2)  :func:`~DirectGuiBase.defineoptions` is called.  defineoption creates:\n\n    self._constructorKeywords = { keyword: [value, useFlag] }\n        A dictionary of the keyword options specified as part of the\n        constructor keywords can be of the form 'component_option', where\n        component is the name of a widget's component, a component group or a\n        component alias.",
