  "content": "Panda3D does distinguish between animated and non-animated geometry, however. \"Animated\" in this sense means that the geometry changes shape; a flying ball wouldn't be considered animated, because it stays a sphere. Animated models are explained further in the animated-models section; this section just explains how to load non-animated geometry.\n\nLoading a model from a file isn't the only way to put geometry on the screen. Many engines provide tools to create terrain, and store that terrain into heightmap images. Panda3D can generate geometry for a kind of heightmap terrain; refer to the terrain section for more information. For many simple scenes, though, it is simpler to use a static model loaded from a file rather than a dynamically generated heightmap terrain.\n\nFile Formats",
