  "content": "Supported Model Formats\n\nPanda3D contains an extensible plug-in system for loading model files. These plug-ins enable Panda3D to load models in a variety of formats, without requiring an explicit conversion step. This page lists the formats and plug-ins available for loading models into Panda3D.\n\nBAM Format\n\nThe most powerful file format that Panda3D supports is BAM. This is a direct binary representation of the internal object structure of Panda3D. As such it supports almost all of the objects you can create in Panda3D, and any model can be converted to BAM without loss of information. You can also save any scene graph structure in Panda3D back to a BAM file using the ~.NodePath.write_bam_file() call.",
