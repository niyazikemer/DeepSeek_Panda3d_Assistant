  "content": "However, when your DisplayRegions overlap, or when they each need to have a different background color, you may need to clear the DisplayRegions individually. Consider the following example:\n\nPanda must draw this scene by first clearing the window to a gray background, then drawing the contents of the larger display region (with the panda), then clearing the smaller, nested display region to a black background, and then finally drawing the contents of the smaller display region.\n\nYou can control the clear operations per DisplayRegion, as well as on the overall GraphicsOutput. The following methods are defined for both DisplayRegions and GraphicsOutputs:\n\npython\n\nwin.setClearColorActive(flag)\nwin.setClearColor((r, g, b, a))\n\ncpp\n\nwin->set_clear_color_active(flag);\nwin->set_clear_color(LVecBase4(r, g, b, a));",
