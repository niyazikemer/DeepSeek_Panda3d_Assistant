  "content": "The membership scalar is optional. If specified, it is a value between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates the fraction of dominance this joint has over the vertices. This is used to implement soft-skinning, so that each vertex may have partial ownership in several joints.\n\nThe <VertexRef> entry may also be given to ordinary <Group> nodes. In this case, it treats the geometry as if it was parented under the group in the first place. Non-total membership assignments are meaningless.\n\nBundle and Table entries\n\nA table is a set of animated values for joints. A tree of tables with the same structure as the corresponding tree of joints must be defined for each character to be animated. Such a tree is placed under a <Bundle> node, which provides a handle within Panda to the tree as a whole.\n\nBundles may only contain tables; tables may contain more tables, bundles, or any one of the following (<Scalar> entries are optional, and default as shown):",
