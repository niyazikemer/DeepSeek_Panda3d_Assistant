  "content": "Completeness means that Panda3D contains many unexciting but essential tools: scene graph browsing, performance monitoring, animation optimizers, and so forth.\n\nError tolerance is about the fact that all game developers create bugs. When you do, you want your engine to give you a clear error message and help you find the mistake. Too many engines will just crash if you pass the wrong value to a function. Panda3D almost never crashes, and much code is dedicated to the problem of tracking and isolating errors.\n\nFinally, to come back to power and speed: to gauge Panda3D's capabilities you can take a look at the Sample Programs <samples>. These are short programs that demonstrate a sampling of Panda3D's capabilities. The screenshots have frame-rates in the upper-right corner, taken on a Radeon X700. Note that some samples are old and use placeholder art and so are not great examples of Panda3D's visual capabilities.",
