This can be used for\n        programmer animation of a particular joint at runtime.\n\n        The parameter node should be the NodePath for the node whose\n        transform will animate the joint.  If node is None, a new node\n        will automatically be created and loaded with the joint's\n        initial transform.  In either case, the node used will be\n        returned.",
