You can, of course, implement a do-later task with a regular task that simply does nothing until a certain amount of time has elapsed (as in the above example), but using a do-later is a much more efficient way to achieve the same thing, especially if you will have many such tasks waiting around.\n\ntaskMgr.doMethodLater(delayTime, myFunction, 'Task Name')\n\nIn this example myFunction must accept a task variable. If you wish to use a function that does not accept a task variable:\n\ntaskMgr.doMethodLater(delayTime, myFunction, 'Task Name', extraArgs = [variables])\n\nNote: if you wish to call a function which takes no variables simply pass extraArgs = []",
