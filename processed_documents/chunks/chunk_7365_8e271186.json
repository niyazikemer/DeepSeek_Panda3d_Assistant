  "content": "The overall size of the DirectGui object is controlled with the frameSize keyword. This is a four-tuple of floating-point numbers of the form (left, right, bottom, top), which specifies the bounding box region of the DirectGui object. That is, the lower-left corner will be at position (left, 0, bottom), and the upper-right will be at (right, 0, top). Note that these values represent coordinates from the origin of the frame. Setting the frameSize to (-0.1, 0.1, -0.1, 0.1), for instance, will create a box, 0.2 units wide and 0.2 units in height, with 0,0 being the center of the frame located at pos on the screen.\n\nThe frameSize keyword is optional. If you omit it, the default frameSize is computed based on the bounding box of the text, geom, and/or image that you have specified.",
