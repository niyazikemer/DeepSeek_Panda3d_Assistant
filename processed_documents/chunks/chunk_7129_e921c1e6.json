  "content": "DirectOptionMenu\n\nThe DirectOptionMenu class models a popup menu with an arbitrary number of items. It is composed of the menu bar, the popup marker, and the popup menu itself. The popup menu appears when the menu is clicked on and disappears when the user clicks again; if the click was inside the popup, the selection changes. By default, the text on the menu changes to whatever item is currently selected. The attributes that affect the appearance of the menu bar don't apply to the popup. Make sure to specify the items option or it may crash.",
