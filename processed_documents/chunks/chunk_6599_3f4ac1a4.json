  "content": "Each GeomVertexReader keeps track of the current read row, which is initially 0; the current value can be retrieved by getReadRow(). Each call to a getData function returns the value of the column at the current read row, and then increments the current read row. It is an error to call getData when the read row has reached the end of the data, but you can call isAtEnd(), which returns true when the reader has reached the end. Thus, you can iterate through all the rows of a vertex table by repeatedly calling getData until isAtEnd() returns true.",
