  "content": "However, be careful not to optimize prematurely. Some developers spend a lot of time early in the development process optimizing parts of the game that end up being changed or removed later on in the process anyway. To avoid wasting time optimizing things unnecessarily, it is mainly useful to perform optimization at the end of the development cycle, or at the point when testing the game becomes more difficult due to excessively low framerate.\n\nHow Fast Should it Run?\n\nOne of the things that makes performance tuning difficult is that you need to find things that are running slower than they \"should\" - but how do you know how fast something \"should\" run? Experienced game programmers have a gut feel for what their video card should be capable of, but inexperienced ones often don't really know what to expect. This makes performance tuning that much harder.",
