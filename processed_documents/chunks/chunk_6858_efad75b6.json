  "content": "TextNode::set_tab_width(). text-texture-margin int 2 This is the number of texels of empty space reserved around each\nglyph in the texture. Setting this value larger will decrease the\ntendency for adjacent glyphs to bleed into each other at small sizes,\nbut it will increase amount of wasted texture memory. text-use-harfbuzz bool 0 Set this true to enable HarfBuzz support, which offers superior text\nshaping and better support for non-Latin text. text-wrap-mode enum border_color The default wrap mode for dynamic text fonts texture-anisotropic-degree int 1 This specifies the default anisotropic degree that is applied to a\ntexture in the absence of a particular anisotropic degree setting (that\nis, a texture for which the anisotropic degree is 0, meaning the default\nsetting). It should be 1 to disable anisotropic filtering, or a higher\nnumber to enable it. Note if this variable is changed at runtime, you\nmay need to reload textures explicitly in order to change their visible",
