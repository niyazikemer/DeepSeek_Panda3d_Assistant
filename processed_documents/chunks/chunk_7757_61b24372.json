(e.g. the left shift key sends both \"lshift\" and \"shift\" events when pressed) Save for \"num_lock\", \"*\", and \"+\" the numpad keys are indistinguishable from the main keyboard counterparts. (e.g. when Num Lock is on the both the numpad and keyboard 1 keys send \"1\")\n\nHere are some examples in code:\n\npython\n\n# Calls the function __spam() on the k key event.\nself.accept('k', self.__spam)\n\n# Calls __spam(eggs, sausage, bacon) on release of the K key.\nself.accept('k-up', self.__spam, [eggs, sausage, bacon,])\n\n# Exit on pressing the escape button.\nself.accept('escape', sys.exit)\n\n# Call spamAndEggs when up is pressed and at autorepeat if held.\nself.accept('arrow_up', self.spamAndEggs)\nself.accept('arrow_up-repeat', self.spamAndEggs)",
