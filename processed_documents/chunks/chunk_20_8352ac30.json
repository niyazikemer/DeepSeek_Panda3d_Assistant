At first, the feature lists were short: the cards could draw polygons, do some basic texturing, a little alpha blending, and that was it. As time went on, the list of features increased and increased: offscreen buffers, multisampling, hardware transform and lighting, and so forth. Every time somebody thought of some new rendering trick they wanted to try, they had to design a new video card with the new ability. People are creative, so soon, the list of known features exceeded 350 - this is not an exaggeration, see the OpenGL extension registry! Each of these features corresponded to each of the hundreds of rendering tricks that people had thought of so far. Yet, people kept designing new video card features, because their creativity for inventing new rendering tricks had not nearly been exhausted.",
