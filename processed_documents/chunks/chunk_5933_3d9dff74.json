  "content": "You may find the call to prim.decompose() useful (as shown in the above example). This call automatically decomposes higher-order primitive types, like GeomTristrips and GeomTrifans, into the equivalent component primitive types, like GeomTriangles; but when called on a GeomTriangles, it returns the GeomTriangles object unchanged. Similarly, GeomLinestrips will be decomposed into GeomLines. This way you can write code that doesn't have to know anything about GeomTristrips and GeomTrifans, which are fairly complex; it can assume it will only get the much simpler GeomTriangles (or, in the case of lines or points, GeomLines and GeomPoints, respectively).",
