  "content": "Multithreaded Render Pipeline\n\nAs of Panda3D version 1.8, Panda supports a multithreaded render pipeline for optimal performance on multiprocessor machines. If your computer has at least two CPU cores (for instance, because you have a dual-core or quad-core CPU), then you can direct Panda to utilize up to three different CPU cores for rendering the scene, which can lead to a theoretical performance improvement of up to 3 times faster than a simple single-CPU approach. (In practice, an improvement of 3x is rare; improvements of 1.5x to 2x are far more common.)\n\nThis feature isn't enabled all the time, partly because it is still somewhat new and experimental, and partly because it is not always the best idea to enable this feature, depending on your precise needs.",
