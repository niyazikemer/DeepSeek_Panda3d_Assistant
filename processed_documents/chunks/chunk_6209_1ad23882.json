If you would make the entire character one solid body, you wouldn't be able to move them independently of each other, and if you made every body part a separate solid body, all the body parts would fall off since they are not attached to each other. This is where Joints come in.\n\nJoints are basically used to attach bodies to each other, or to attach a body to the environment. There are several different kinds of joints: OdeHingeJoint, OdeBallJoint, OdeSliderJoint, just to name a few.
