  "content": "\"\"\"This file demonstrates one way to create a mirror effect in Panda.\nCall :func:`setupMirror()` to create a mirror in the world that reflects\neverything in front of it.\n\nThe approach taken here is to create an offscreen buffer with its own\ncamera that renders its view into a texture, which is then applied to\nthe mirror geometry.  The mirror's camera is repositioned each frame\nwith a task to keep it always on the opposite side of the mirror from\nthe main camera.\n\nThis demonstrates the basic interface for offscreen\nrender-to-a-texture in Panda.  Similar approaches can be used for\nrelated effects, such as a remote spy camera presenting its view onto\na closed-circuit television screen.",
