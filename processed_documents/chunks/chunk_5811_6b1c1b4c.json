  "content": "An Egg file can contain static geometry, but it can also contain information for animating the model, as well as information about the model's material, ie. what color the material has, and how this color changes under the influence of lighting). However, unlike BAM, it cannot represent all of the things that are possible in Panda3D. For instance, light sources are not represented.\n\nPanda3D provides various tools for converting models to the Egg format <converting-to-egg>. Furthermore, there are exporter plug-ins for various modelling packages that are able to produce Egg files.\n\nThe plug-in for loading .egg files is provided with Panda3D out of the box. Panda3D also provides an API for manipulating Egg files programmatically. The .EggData class is the main entry point of this API.\n\nglTF Plug-In",
