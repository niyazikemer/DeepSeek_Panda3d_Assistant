  "content": "Another approach, that doesn't involve explicitly munging the clock, would be simply to wait to start the interval until the next frame, for instance with a doMethodLater().\n\ntaskMgr.doMethodLater(0, lambda task, posival=posival: posival.start(),\n                      'startInterval')\n\nI have a bunch of Maya Animations of one model in different mb files. I used maya2egg to port them into panda, but only one of the animations work.\n\nThe key is to use the -cn <character's name> flag in maya2egg for every file. This ensures that the files work together. Let's say you are making an animated dog. You have the following animations:\n\ndog-walk.mb\ndog-sit.mb\ndog-run.mb\n\nTo convert these into panda, you would call\n\nmaya2egg6 dog-walk.mb -a model -cn dog -o dog-model.egg\n\nNote, we can grab the model from any of the animations, as long as they are all using the exact same rig:",
