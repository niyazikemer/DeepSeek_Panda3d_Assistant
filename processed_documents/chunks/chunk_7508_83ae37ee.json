  "content": "Panda's Built-in Physics Engine <panda3d-physics-engine>: Panda3D has a very basic physics engine built-in that may apply forces to classes. The physics engine can handle angular or linear forces, as well as viscosity.\n\nBullet Physics Engine <bullet>: This is a good choice for more advanced physics in most games.\n\nThe Open Dynamics Engine <ode>: This is another option provided as part of the Panda3D binaries, but does not support as many features as Bullet.\n\nWhen you have a very simple simulation, you will most likely want to use the built-in physics, which works with Panda's collision system. However, many applications that need physics simulations may find it inadequate, as the Bullet system is far more full-featured.\n\nbuiltin/index bullet/index ode/index",
