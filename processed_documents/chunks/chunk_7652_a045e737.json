This means body A will fall down since it is affected by gravity, but body B will always stay where it is. Neither can body B be pushed by dynamic bodies.\n\nUsing a cone/twist constraint we can connect body A to body B. The cone/twist constraint will allow body A to move within a cone fixed to body B. Body A will also be able to rotate around the axis from the cone's vertex point to body A ('twist' around this axis).",
