For these cases, you can simply define a defaultFilter method that does everything you need. If a particular filterStateName() method does not exist, then the FSM will call the method named defaultFilter() instead; you can put any logic here that handles the general case.\n\nFor instance, we could have defined the above FSM using just the defaultFilter method, and a lookup table:",
