  "content": "Coverage: The 'coverage' of a texture refers to the fraction of the area in the texture image that is actually used, according to the UV's that appear in the various egg files. If a texture's coverage is less than 1, only some of the texture image is used (and only this part will be written to the palette). If the coverage is greater than 1, the texture repeats that number of times. A repeating texture may still be palettized by writing the required number of copies into the palette image, according to the coverage area. This attribute specifies the maximum coverage to allow for any texture before rejecting it from the palette. It may be any floating-point number greater than zero. Set this to 1 to avoid palettizing repeating textures altogether.\n\nAfter setting all the attribute, click on Save Attributes button to save all the attributes to a .txa file. Last, add this to batch list, after clicking run batch, the palette will be generated.\n\nEgg-palettize for multiple eggs",
