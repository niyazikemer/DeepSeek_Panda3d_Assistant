  "content": "Each of the getData family of functions supported by GeomVertexReader returns the value of the data in the current column, converted to the requested type. The 'i' suffix indicates an integer value, while the lack of this suffix indicates a floating-point value; the digit indicates the number of components you expect to receive.\n\nFor instance, getData2() always returns a VBase2, regardless of the type of data actually stored in the column. If the column contains a 2-component value such as a 2-D texture coordinate, then the returned value will represent the (U, V) value in that column. However, if the column type does not match the requested type, a conversion is quietly made; for instance, if you call getData2() but the column actually contains a 3-D texture coordinate, the third component will be omitted from the return value, which will still be a VBase2.",
