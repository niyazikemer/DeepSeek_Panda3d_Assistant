  "content": "Particle Factories\n\nThere are two types of particle factories, Point and ZSpin. The particle panel shows a third, Oriented, but this factory does not currently work. The differences between these factories lie in the orientation and rotational abilities. First, there are some common variables to the factories.\n\nVariable Definition Values lifespanBase Average lifespan in seconds [0, infinity) lifespanSpread Variation in lifespan [0, infinity) massBase Average particle mass [0, infinity) massSpread Variation in particle mass [0, infinity) terminalVelocityBase Average particle terminal velocity [0, infinity) terminalVelocitySpread Variation in terminal velocity [0, infinity)\n\nPoint particle factories generate simple particles. They have no additional parameters. ZSpin particle factories generate particles that spin around the Z axis, the vertical axis in Panda3D. They have some additional parameters.",
