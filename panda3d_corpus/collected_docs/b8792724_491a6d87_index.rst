Panda3D Manual
==============

Welcome to the Panda3D documentation! Panda3D is an open-source, free-to-use 3D
engine made for the development of realtime 3D games, visualizations,
simulations, experiments â€” you name it! It consists of a library of subroutines
that can be used with either the Python or C++ programming language, as well as
a few tools to assist with development and debugging.

.. only:: python

   There are two versions of the manual: one for Python users and one for C++
   users. Use the link in the sidebar to switch between the versions.
   You are currently viewing the manual for **Python** users.

.. only:: cpp

   There are two versions of the manual: one for Python users and one for C++
   users. Use the link in the sidebar to switch between the versions.
   You are currently viewing the manual for **C++** users.

The manual is divided up into sections, which are listed below. You can at any
time use the sidebar on the left side to navigate between the different sections
and their contained pages.

Introduction
------------

We recommend that beginners start out by reading through the
:ref:`Introduction <intro>` section, which walks through the process of
installing Panda3D and ends with a "Hello World" tutorial explaining how to
create a very small Panda3D program, to get a sense for what using the engine
looks like.

Programming with Panda3D
------------------------

This section of the manual explains the various features of Panda3D and the
various concepts that underpin the library. It is littered with example code and
links to the :ref:`API reference <reference>`, which should be studied
side-by-side with the manual to get a full understanding of how to operate the
various classes.

Asset Pipeline
--------------

This section explains how to get artistic content (such as models and textures)
produced in other programs imported into Panda3D.

Performance Optimization
------------------------

Performance optimization is often a necessary step in the production of a 3D
game in order to make the game work on as broad a range of computer hardware as
possible. This section explains how to find and fix performance issues using the
powerful performance analysis tools that Panda3D offers.

Distribution
------------

This section explains how to compile a completed Panda3D application into an
executable file and package it up for distribution.

More Resources
--------------

Aside from this manual, there are a number of other resources that may be useful
when studying Panda3D, including books, sample programs, and user-contributed
tutorials. This section contains links to those other resources.
