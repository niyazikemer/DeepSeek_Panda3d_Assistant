direct
======

DIRECT is a set of Python-based tools that are layered on top of core Panda3D,
which is written in C++. It includes the DirectGUI tools, the task system, the
Interval system, a high-level class for animated characters, and several other
systems.

There are additional C++ classes to support these modules, which can be found
in the :py:mod:`panda3d.direct` module.
