Distributed Node
================

The :class:`~direct.distributed.DistributedNode.DistributedNode` class is a
specialized distributed object and defines functions available from PandaNodes,
such as position and rotation. Simply check the direct.dc file to see which
network calls are available.

This DO can be used if the repository has been initialized with the direct.dc
added to the dc files list.
