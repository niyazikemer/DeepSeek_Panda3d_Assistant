-   Supports Windows versions all the way from Windows XP to Windows 10
-   Supports Mac OS X 10.6 "Snow Leopard" through macOS 11 "Big Sur"
-   Only one external dependency: working graphics driver
-   Sample programs run right out of Start Menu
-   No compilation step needed

Full Python Integration

[image]

Automatically-generated wrappers expose full functionality of the
engine.

-   All Python versions from 2.7 to newest 3.10 supported
-   Highly optimized: all core functionality in C++
-   Thoroughly-tested: two commercial MMOs in Python
-   Panda3D structures garbage collected when using Python
-   Manual and sample programs use Python

Exposes Full Power of Graphics API

[image]

Modern OpenGL/DirectX features exposed directly to Panda3D user:

-   High-level shader languages: GLSL, Cg
-   Powerful interface between shaders and engine
-   Support for render-to-texture, multiple render targets
-   Use of depth/shadow/stencil textures
-   Support for tessellation and compute shaders

Shader Generation

Many advanced rendering techniques now fully automatic:

-   Special Maps: Normal Map, Gloss Map, Glow Map
-   HDR Rendering: Tone Mapping, Bloom Filter
-   Cel Shading: Threshold Lighting, Inking
-   Shadow Mapping
-   Fullscreen filters such as Bloom, Cartoon Inking, Volumetric
    Lightning, Blur/Sharpen and Ambient Occlusion, as well as the
    ability to use your own
-   More to come

3D Pipeline

-   Particle editor included for creating and editing particle effects

GUI

[image]

Panda3D comes with a set of tools for the creation of a graphical
interface:

-   Native DirectGUI system
-   Efficient text rendering system
-   Various third-party library options

Artificial Intelligence

[image]

Simple AI library "PandaAI" included:

    Obstacle Avoidance, Path Following
-   Path Finding
-   Navigation Mesh generator for EGG files

Performance Monitoring

[image]

Powerful performance monitoring and optimization tools:

-   Identifies bottlenecks, both CPU and GPU
-   CPU time use decomposed into more than 250 categories
-   Counts meshes, polygons, textures, transforms, state changes, etc
-   Allows user-defined CPU-usage categories
-   Tools for batching and state-change minimization
-   Tools to merge textures and minimize texture switches
-   Times draw calls using GPU timer queries

Debugging Tools

[image]

Heavy emphasis on error tolerance and debuggable code:

-   Extreme resistance to crashing, even when errors are made
-   More than 5000 assertion-checks to catch errors early
-   Reference-counted data structures minimize memory leaks
-   Many tools to examine internal state (one shown here)

Mature, Complete System

[image]

Mature system used to deliver several commercial games. Contains
everything you need, not just the "sexy" stuff:

-   Converters for a number of file formats
-   Font file importers
-   Tools to package games into redistributables
-   Means to pack art assets into encrypted bundles
-   Lots of other boring but essential stuff
