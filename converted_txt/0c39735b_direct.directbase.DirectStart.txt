direct.directbase.DirectStart

python

direct.directbase.DirectStart

This is a shortcut, instantiating ~direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase
automatically on import. Doing so opens a graphical window, sets up the
scene graph <the-scene-graph>, and many other subsystems of Panda3D.
This example demonstrates its use:

  import direct.directbase.DirectStart
      base.run()

While it may be considered useful for quick prototyping in the
interactive Python shell, using it in applications is not considered
good style. As such, it has been deprecated starting with Panda3D 1.9.
Any import to DirectStart is equivalent to and may be replaced with the
following code:

  from direct.showbase.ShowBase import ShowBase
      base = ShowBase()

The ~builtins.base variable is automatically written to the built-in
scope, so that it can be directly accessed anywhere in any Python
module. Various other variables are written to the global scope as well,
see builtins for a listing.

See the ~.ShowBase.ShowBase class for further information on the
~builtins.base variable.
