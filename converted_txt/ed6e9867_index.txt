Sample Programs in the Distribution

The Panda3D Distribution includes quite a few sample programs. The
following is a list of what's included, and which features of the engine
each sample demonstrates. If you are just learning Panda3D, take a look
at the ones marked as "Beginner" difficulty.

To run a sample program, you need to install the Panda3D SDK. If you're
a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If
you're a Linux user, you'll find the sample programs in
/usr/share/panda3d. On macOS, you'll find them in
/Developer/Examples/Panda3D/ (or /Library/Developer/Examples/Panda3D as
of Panda3D 1.10.5). Alternatively, you can download the samples
separately from the download page.
