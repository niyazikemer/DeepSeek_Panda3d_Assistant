Audio Managers

Sound effects and music in code are implemented as .AudioManager
objects. You can access these audio managers with the following code:

    sfxMgr = base.sfxManagerList[0]
    musicMgr = base.musicManager

In ~builtins.base, sfxManagerList
<direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.sfxManagerList> is a list of
.AudioManager objects intended to be used for sound effects, and
musicManager <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.musicManager> is an
.AudioManager object intended to be used for music.

Each .AudioManager object can have 16 different sounds cached at a given
time. This value is actually set as the audio-cache-limit in the panda
config.prc (found in your install directory) and can be changed.

python

By default, base.musicManager
<direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.musicManager> has a limit of 1
concurrent sound, however. This limit can be explicitly increased using
the following code:

    # Allow playing two music files at the same time.
    base.musicManager.setConcurrentSoundLimit(2)

There are times where either sound effects, music, or both should be
disabled and later enabled. These commands affect entire categories of
sounds. Passing True or False in the last 2 functions will disable or
enable the respective groups.

    base.disableAllAudio()
    base.enableAllAudio()
    base.enableMusic(True)
    base.enableSoundEffects(True)

Positional audio is implemented through a wrapper of these objects and
is covered in the next section, 3d-audio.
