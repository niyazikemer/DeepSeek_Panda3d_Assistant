Explanation

This sample program demonstrates lighting in panda. Lighting in panda
can add a lot of depth into a scene. In panda, you can create point,
directional, ambient and spot lights (for a detailed description of
these lights, see the manual link below). Lights in Panda can also
optionally cast shadows. For more information on lighting, please
consult the Panda3D online manual.
