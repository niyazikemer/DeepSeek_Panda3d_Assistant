API Reference

python

The Panda3D Python API consists of two packages: the panda3d core
library, which is written in C++, and the direct library, which is
written in Python. This section of the documentation aims to give a
complete overview of all the classes and functions defined in these two
libraries.

The C++ part of the API reference is incomplete. Missing information can
be looked up in the older Doxygen reference:

direct - Python support library

DIRECT is a set of Python-based tools that are layered on top of core
Panda3D, which is written in C++. It includes the DirectGUI tools, the
task system, the Interval system, a high-level class for animated
characters, and several other systems.

There are additional C++ classes to support these modules, which can be
found in the panda3d.direct module.
