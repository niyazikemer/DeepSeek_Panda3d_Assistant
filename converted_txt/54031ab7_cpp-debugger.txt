Running Panda3D under the C++ Debugger

These instructions show how to compile and run panda from inside the
Microsoft Visual Studio debugger.

Before you Begin

The first step is to download the Panda source code and compile it. The
instructions can be found in the section building-from-source. Be sure
to compile with the Optimize setting of 1, otherwise, Visual Studio will
not be able to debug properly. Once you have compiled Panda3D, start up
Visual Studio, and ask it to create a new project:

[]

There are four pieces of information you need to enter into the new
project dialog:

-   Tell it to make a "C++ project"
-   Tell it to use a "Makefile"
-   Tell it the name of the project, "debugpanda"
-   Tell it where the panda source tree is (ie, "c:panda3d-b")

[]

Click ok, and confirm. You have now created the project, and the project
is open for editing. You now need to access the "solution explorer:"

[]

Normally, you can see the solution explorer in the upper-right corner of
Visual Studio. It should show your project name (debugpanda). The word
"debugpanda" needs to be highlighted - if it is not, click on it:

[]

Now that your project is selected, you can edit its project properties:

[]

The project property dialog initially looks like this. It contains three
subpanels, the "General" panel, the "Debugging" panel, and the "NMake"
subpanel. You can see these three subheadings in the left pane:

[]

There is nothing to fill in on the general panel, so switch to the
debugging panel. You need to fill in the command name, the command
arguments, and the working directory. For now, we will ask it to debug
the Actors/Robots sample program. Since visual studio puts the project
file in a subdirectory, the paths need to be preceded by ".." to get to
the root of the panda source tree:

[]

Finally, switch to the "NMake" panel. Here, you can tell it what the
command is to recompile panda. I use a bat file "mkp.bat" to compile
panda. Since the project file is in a subdirectory, the command needs to
be preceded by "cd .." in order to get back to the root of the panda
source tree:

[]

Visual studio now knows how to run panda, and how to compile it. You can
run your program (in this case, the "Actors/Robots" tutorial) by
clicking on the Debug menu:

[]

You can rebuild panda at any time by clicking on the "Build" menu:

[]

Now that you are running in the debugger, you can open any panda source
file and set a breakpoint, or examine data. Of course, it may be
advantageous to learn how to use the python debugger as well as the C++
debugger.
