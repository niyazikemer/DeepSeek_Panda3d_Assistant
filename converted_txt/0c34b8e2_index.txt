Cg Shader Tutorial

Caution

Support for Cg shaders will be deprecated in an upcoming version of
Panda3D.

Cg Shader Tutorials

Panda has the ability to process shaders written in the Cg shader
language. In this tutorial series, you will learn how to write shaders
for Panda3D in Cg. While there are panda specific things in this
tutorial you should be able to learn how to write Cg shaders that can be
used in other engines.

Pre-requisites

You should be able to write a simple math program in C. Do not
underestimate this. If you start writing your own shaders without any
prior knowledge about a C-like language it is as hard as starting to
write a Panda3D application without knowing anything about Python. Some
resources you might want to look at:

-   C Programming Wikibook

You should have a solid grasp of Panda basics. Read
the hello world <tutorial> tutorial and understand the "Solar System"
sample that comes with the Panda3D distribution. You should also have a
good understanding of how the scene graph <the-scene-graph> works. If
you're interested in writing a shadow mapping shader, it helps to have a
solid understanding of how the depth buffer <depth-test-and-depth-write>
works.

Read the first chapter from NVIDIA's Cg Tutorial. You do not have to
understand it fully, but at least you know who invented Cg and what it
is for. The NVIDIA and ATI developer sites also have plenty of useful
information about shaders.

You should also have the
List of Possible Shader Inputs <list-of-possible-cg-shader-inputs> page
handy.

Note

The use of Cg will be deprecated in a future version of Panda3D.
