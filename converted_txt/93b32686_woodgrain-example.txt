Woodgrain Example

The following program will generate and write out a 3-D texture to
simulate woodgrain:

woodgrain-example.py

The resulting images look like this:

[Woodgrain_0.jpg] [Woodgrain_1.jpg] [Woodgrain_2.jpg] [Woodgrain_3.jpg]
[Woodgrain_4.jpg] [Woodgrain_5.jpg] [Woodgrain_6.jpg] [Woodgrain_7.jpg]

To get consistent (over multiple runs of the program) values from the
PerlinNoise functions a seed value other than 0 has to be used, as
specifying a seed value of 0 tells the noise function to use a random
seed.

The table_size is 256 by default.

PerlinNoise3( scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ, table_size, seed)

PerlinNoise2( scaleX, scaleY, table_size, seed)

PerlinNoise( table_size, seed )
