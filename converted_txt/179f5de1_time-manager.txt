Time Manager

A very specific distributed object which usually resides on the AI
server is the .TimeManager. This object, when created is also propagated
to the clients if they define interest in the specific zone the manager
has been created in.

Clients may also simply access the time manager from the timeManager
variable defined in the CR when it has been created on the AI and the
client has stated interest in the zone the time manager lives in.

To make the time manager available from the AI server, create a
.TimeManagerAI instance. Simply do the same as you’d do to create a
DirectObject.

    self.timeManager = self.createDistributedObject(
        className = 'TimeManagerAI',
        zoneId = 1)
