Camera Control

Panda3D's camera is considered a .PandaNode. It can therefore be
manipulated as any other node.

The actual camera is defined in ShowBase as a .NodePath named
base.cam <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.cam>. There is also a plain
node above the camera, which is a NodePath called
base.camera <direct.showbase.ShowBase.ShowBase.camera>. Generally you
want to control the latter with your code.
