Clients
=======

This is the part that the end-users will see and have running on their own
machines. These applications are primarily there to connect to the server,
gather user input and handle the audiovisual output. They should not have to
handle much of the game logic as thatâ€™s handled by the AI server.

The important parts which have to be implemented in client applications to work
with the distributed network will be shown in the next chapters.
