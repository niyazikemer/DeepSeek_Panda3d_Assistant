.. rubric:: Explanation

This sample program shows planets orbiting around the sun, and a moon orbiting
one of the planets. If you just stare at the moon, you'll realize that its
motion is a spiral:

The motion of the moon is only simple if you think about it in relative terms:
the moon is moving in a circle relative to the planet, and the planet is
moving in a circle relative to the sun.

This panda program shows how to implement relative movement and relative
positioning.
