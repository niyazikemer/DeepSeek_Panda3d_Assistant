Hardware Support
================

Panda3D provides multiple ways to access the various devices connected to your
system. The following sections will show you how to gain input from mouse,
keyboard and other video game related input devices like gamepads, joysticks
and steering wheels using Panda3D's built-in device support.

As of now, Panda3D will have access to any device that is recognized by Evdev
or the older Linux Joystick API on Linux based systems and XInput on Windows
based systems. There also is a section for VR devices which is geared towards
Carnegie Mellon University's virtual reality equipment.
