Advanced Loading Techniques
===========================

Whereas the basics of loading models and animations has already been touched
upon in the :ref:`model-files` and :ref:`animated-models` sections, Panda's
asset loading system is very advanced, supporting loads from arbitrary sources,
a virtual file system, and asynchronous (threaded) loading.  This section
describes some of the possibilities in more detail.
